abstract={In this work, we aimed at the production of bovine sodium caseinate (NaCAS) hydrolysates by means of an extracellular protease from Bacillus sp. P7. Mass spectrometry was carried out to evaluate peptide mass distribution and identified sequences of peptides with a signal/noise ratio higher than 10. Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of hydrolysates were evaluated. An acid-induced aggregation process of the hydrolysates and their corresponding mixtures with NaCAS were also analyzed. The results showed that the enzymatic hydrolysis produced peptides, mostly lower than 3kDa, with different bioactivities depending on the time of hydrolysis (ti). These hydrolysates lost their ability to aggregate by addition of glucono-δ-lactone, and their incorporation into NaCAS solutions alter the kinetics of the process. Also, the degree of compactness of the NaCAS aggregates, estimated by the fractal dimension of aggregates, was not significantly altered by the incorporation of hydrolysates. However, at higher protein concentrations, when the decrease in pH leads to the formation of NaCAS acid gels, the presence of hydrolysates alters the microstructure and rheological behavior of these gels. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Normal incidence scattering of hydrogen atoms off a H-covered tungsten W(110) surface is simulated via quasiclassical trajectories. A density functional theory (DFT) based multiadsorbate potential is developed to model a wide range of surface coverages, θ = 0.25-1 monolayer (ML), reproducing the surface arrangements observed at low temperature. The competition between hot-atom (HA) and Eley-Rideal (ER) abstraction mechanisms is studied for collision energies of the projectile atom in the range Ep = 0.1-5.0 eV (Ep = 0.1-2.0 eV) for θ = 0.25 ML (θ = 0.5, 0.75, and 1 ML) coverage. Cross sections, final energies of the recombination products, and reaction times are analyzed. At low coverage and low collision energy, HA dominates the abstraction, whereas HA and ER cross-sections become similar when collision energy increases. The vibrational distribution of recombined H2 molecules at finite coverage is found to be in better agreement with experiments than the one computed within the single adsorbate limit. At high surface coverage, ER dominates abstraction but the dynamical observables highlight the similarity between both reaction mechanisms, thus suggesting that abstraction may be considered as a unique process. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Electron back-scattered diffraction together with scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to study nucleation of microstructural fatigue cracks in reduced-activation ferritic-martensitic steel, EUROFER 97. Cylindrical specimens were cycled over different plastic-strain ranges in order to evaluate the evolution of the dislocation structure. Surface-damage evolution was studied in smooth notched specimens by an optical in situ system equipped with a high-resolution camera. In order to understand the crack-initiation mechanism, the dislocation microstructure that develops in the near-surface regions of the notch was compared with that of the bulk. The results demonstrate a strong influence of lath-martensite boundaries on fatigue-crack nucleation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper presents a method for amplitude and phase retrieval in simultaneous π/2 phase-shifting heterodyne interferometry. The used optical setup admits the introduction of a temporal carrier and simultaneously verifies the two-beam interferometry equation for each intensity signal, which are π/2 rad out of phase (quadrature). The spatiotemporal recovering process is obtained by isolating the object amplitude and phase using wavelet transform analysis of the temporal series composed by the difference between the measured pixel intensities corresponding to each quadrature signal. This process is subsequently improved by introducing a framework based on the synchrosqueezing transform, which recovers the data of interest with higher accuracy when very low scattering amplitudes and phase excursions must be determined in noisy working conditions. The advantages and limitations of the presented method are analyzed and discussed using numerical simulations and also experimental data obtained from temporal speckle pattern interferometry. © 2015 Optical Society of America.},
