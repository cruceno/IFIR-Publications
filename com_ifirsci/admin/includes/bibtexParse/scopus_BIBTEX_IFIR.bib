abstract={We present the results of an analysis of the large angular scale distribution of the arrival directions of cosmic rays with energy above 4 EeV detected at the Pierre Auger Observatory including for the first time events with zenith angle between 60° and 80°. We perform two Rayleigh analyses, one in the right ascension and one in the azimuth angle distributions, that are sensitive to modulations in right ascension and declination, respectively. The largest departure from isotropy appears in the 98E &gt; 8 EeV energy bin, with an amplitude for the first harmonic in right ascension r1 α = (4.4 ± 1.0) × 10-2, that has a chance probability P (≥1 α) = 6.4 × 10-5, reinforcing the hint previously reported with vertical events alone. © 2015, The American Astronomical Society.

abstract={For the collision system U88++N2 at a collision energy of 90 MeV/u, the energy distribution of electrons being nonradiatively captured from the target into the projectile continuum has been measured under an angle of 0 with respect to the projectile beam axis. This measurement of the electron-capture-to-continuum cusp with the highest effective projectile charge Zpeff=88 at a near-relativistic collision velocity of β≈0.41 is shown to be characterized by a strong asymmetry in the cusp shape. By comparing the data to measurements of the radiative-electron-capture-to-continuum cusp for the same collision system, the opposite asymmetry of the cusp is traced back to the varying underlying mechanisms. The experimental results are compared with the two theoretical calculations available for this process, one of them in the semirelativistic impulse approximation and the other in the nonrelativistic continuum-distorted-wave approach. A corresponding fully relativistic treatment may be motivated by the presented experimental data. © 2015 American Physical Society.},

abstract={The influence of Li impurities on the phase transition, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of KNbO3 ceramics is investigated. We found that Li doping alters the transition temperatures of KNbO3. While the temperature for the orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition decreases, the temperature of the cubic-tetragonal ferroelectric phase transition increases. The dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics are improved by the addition of Li. The experiments were contrasted and complemented with first-principles-based atomic level simulations to gain more insight into the intrinsic properties of the solid solution. We show that the impurities improve the dielectric properties due to a relaxational contribution of the off-center Li ions. The increase of the piezoelectric response is associated to the concentration dependence of the shear piezoelectric coefficients. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of this work was to analyze the evolution of texture of an aluminium AA1050 processed by ECAP and further recrystallization in search of optimum processing conditions to improve formability. The initial material was processed by two different routes: the first set of samples came from a hot rolled coil with a mixture of cube, copper and brass textures and the second from roll casting, exhibiting a strong brass texture. The ECAP deformation followed routes A (no sample rotation between passes), Ay (no sample rotation between passes but keeping the normal to rolling direction parallel to the transverse extrusion axis) and Bc (with a 90o sample rotation around the extrusion axis between passes). Texture evaluation was performed by x-ray analysis and results were analyzed by regular texture and orientation distribution function calculations. The normal and planar anisotropy were measured for the deformed and annealed samples. ECAP orientations were generated mostly by rotation around the transverse axis. 〈111〉//ND; orientations can be generated from S, Goss or copper textures but not from brass or cube textures. Therefore route A and starting with the hot rolled or rolled textures should be considered if 〈111〉//ND orientations are desired. Using route Bc, rotating the existing orientations into a favorable position can generate the desired fiber. The strength of a texture after ECAP depends on the orientations of the initial texture, however the correlation starts vanishing after various ECAP steps and the texture finally smoothes out. When 〈111〉//ND was more intense there was an improvement in the planar anisotropy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Jaundice is a bilirubin excess in humans, usually newborns, but also occurs in adults. In this paper we detail the measurements made in an experimental jaundice lamps device, containing a portable fiber optics single monochromator spectroradiometer Avantes, to measure the spectral irradiance in the visible and near UV (250-800 nm). These measurements were performed to determine the actual emission of the lamps at the end of their useful life when they are written off in a public maternity hospital in Rosario city and consequently, whether it is feasible to extend or shorten their time of use. For this study, four lamps were used and one new as a reference. A Phillips TL20W/52 model were employed. Given the high cost of the lamps and in order to extend their life, we propose a continuous monitoring of the intensity level at the site of newborns patients by photodetector, for the purposes of: a) to change the exposure time interval to maintain the dose when a reduction in the intensity is detected and b) to determine the lifetime of the lamps. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={In this work, we aimed at the production of bovine sodium caseinate (NaCAS) hydrolysates by means of an extracellular protease from Bacillus sp. P7. Mass spectrometry was carried out to evaluate peptide mass distribution and identified sequences of peptides with a signal/noise ratio higher than 10. Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of hydrolysates were evaluated. An acid-induced aggregation process of the hydrolysates and their corresponding mixtures with NaCAS were also analyzed. The results showed that the enzymatic hydrolysis produced peptides, mostly lower than 3kDa, with different bioactivities depending on the time of hydrolysis (ti). These hydrolysates lost their ability to aggregate by addition of glucono-δ-lactone, and their incorporation into NaCAS solutions alter the kinetics of the process. Also, the degree of compactness of the NaCAS aggregates, estimated by the fractal dimension of aggregates, was not significantly altered by the incorporation of hydrolysates. However, at higher protein concentrations, when the decrease in pH leads to the formation of NaCAS acid gels, the presence of hydrolysates alters the microstructure and rheological behavior of these gels. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Normal incidence scattering of hydrogen atoms off a H-covered tungsten W(110) surface is simulated via quasiclassical trajectories. A density functional theory (DFT) based multiadsorbate potential is developed to model a wide range of surface coverages, θ = 0.25-1 monolayer (ML), reproducing the surface arrangements observed at low temperature. The competition between hot-atom (HA) and Eley-Rideal (ER) abstraction mechanisms is studied for collision energies of the projectile atom in the range Ep = 0.1-5.0 eV (Ep = 0.1-2.0 eV) for θ = 0.25 ML (θ = 0.5, 0.75, and 1 ML) coverage. Cross sections, final energies of the recombination products, and reaction times are analyzed. At low coverage and low collision energy, HA dominates the abstraction, whereas HA and ER cross-sections become similar when collision energy increases. The vibrational distribution of recombined H2 molecules at finite coverage is found to be in better agreement with experiments than the one computed within the single adsorbate limit. At high surface coverage, ER dominates abstraction but the dynamical observables highlight the similarity between both reaction mechanisms, thus suggesting that abstraction may be considered as a unique process. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={This paper presents a method for amplitude and phase retrieval in simultaneous π/2 phase-shifting heterodyne interferometry. The used optical setup admits the introduction of a temporal carrier and simultaneously verifies the two-beam interferometry equation for each intensity signal, which are π/2 rad out of phase (quadrature). The spatiotemporal recovering process is obtained by isolating the object amplitude and phase using wavelet transform analysis of the temporal series composed by the difference between the measured pixel intensities corresponding to each quadrature signal. This process is subsequently improved by introducing a framework based on the synchrosqueezing transform, which recovers the data of interest with higher accuracy when very low scattering amplitudes and phase excursions must be determined in noisy working conditions. The advantages and limitations of the presented method are analyzed and discussed using numerical simulations and also experimental data obtained from temporal speckle pattern interferometry. © 2015 Optical Society of America.},

Through the combination of Medium Energy Ion Scattering with Transmission Electron Microscopy, we perform a systematic investigation on core@shell Au@Ag NPs synthesized by an original wet chemical method. For samples synthesized with baths of different AgNO3 concentrations, the present approach allowed us to determine the NP's Ag shell thicknesses distribution of about a few nanometers around the Au core. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Metallocene (MCp2) wires have recently attracted considerable interest in relation to molecular spintronics due to predictions concerning their half-metallic nature. This exciting prospect is however hampered by the little and often-contradictory knowledge we have concerning the metallocene self-assembly and interaction with a metal. Here, we elucidate these aspects by focusing on the adsorption of ferrocene on Cu(111) and Cu(100). Combining low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the two-dimensional molecular arrangement consists of vertical- and horizontal-lying molecules. The noncovalent T-shaped interactions between Cp rings of vertical and horizontal molecules are essential for the stability of the physisorbed molecular layer. These results provide a fresh insight into ferrocene adsorption on surfaces and may serve as an archetypal reference for future work with this important variety of organometallic molecules.

abstract={We report a study of the distributions of the depth of maximum, Xmax, of extensive air-shower profiles with energies above 1017.8eV as observed with the fluorescence telescopes of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The analysis method for selecting a data sample with minimal sampling bias is described in detail as well as the experimental cross-checks and systematic uncertainties. Furthermore, we discuss the detector acceptance and the resolution of the Xmax measurement and provide parametrizations thereof as a function of energy. The energy dependence of the mean and standard deviation of the Xmax distributions are compared to air-shower simulations for different nuclear primaries and interpreted in terms of the mean and variance of the logarithmic mass distribution at the top of the atmosphere. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Using the data taken at the Pierre Auger Observatory between December 2004 and December 2012, we have examined the implications of the distributions of depths of atmospheric shower maximum (Xmax), using a hybrid technique, for composition and hadronic interaction models. We do this by fitting the distributions with predictions from a variety of hadronic interaction models for variations in the composition of the primary cosmic rays and examining the quality of the fit. Regardless of what interaction model is assumed, we find that our data are not well described by a mix of protons and iron nuclei over most of the energy range. Acceptable fits can be obtained when intermediate masses are included, and when this is done consistent results for the proton and iron-nuclei contributions can be found using the available models. We observe a strong energy dependence of the resulting proton fractions, and find no support from any of the models for a significant contribution from iron nuclei. However, we also observe a significant disagreement between the models with respect to the relative contributions of the intermediate components. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract={The aim of this work was to study the formation of bovine sodium caseinate (NaCAS) acid gels induced by addition of glucono-δ-lactone (GDL) in the presence of guar gum (GG). At low biopolymer’s concentrations, a one-phase system was observed, whereas at higher mixture concentrations two-phase systems were formed. Aggregation (at low NaCAS concentrations) and gelation (at high NaCAS concentrations) processes were analyzed through the use of full and fractional factorial experiment designs, using turbidimetric and rheological techniques. Finally, the gel images were obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy and the images were analyzed. Results showed that at low NaCAS concentrations, the presence of GG affects the pH at which aggregation begins but was not significant for the time at which aggregation begins. On the other hand, at high NaCAS concentrations, the concentration of GG only affected significantly the elastic character of acid gels. As polysaccharide concentration increases, the gels obtained were weaker and with larger pores. Also, the formation of NaCAS droplet-shaped structures at certain biopolymer ratio was observed. The presence of GG affects both the rate of gelation and phase separation, which, in turn, determine the type of gel microstructure. Phase separation seems to occur prior to protein gelation because the protein gel network is discontinued, hindering the gel compactness and reducing gel strength. In summary, GG modifies NaCAS stabilization (self-association and phase separation) and the viscoelasticity and microstructure of NaCAS acid gels. The control of such processes and properties would allow obtaining mixture gels with different textures. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

This new mechanism breaks the isotropic features of random adatom diffusion over a single crystal surface, not only about the main directions but also about the sense of movement. The present model allows us to understand all the anomalous growing features characterizing the behaviour of an insulator film, such as aluminum fluoride, over a metallic Cu(1 0 0) single crystal surface. The growth process of this system is characterized by several non-fully understood features, including a large diffusion coefficient, sticking at both sides of steps, and island atomistic arrangement along special directions. Although we focus our analysis on the AlF3/Cu(1 0 0) system, our conclusions may be extended to the diffusion of other complex molecules over different surfaces. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={One of the puzzling characteristics of the pseudogap phase of high-Tc cuprates is the nodal-antinodal dichotomy. While the nodal quasiparticles have a Fermi liquid behaviour, the antinodal ones show non-Fermi liquid features and an associated pseudogap. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and electronic Raman scattering are two valuable tools which have shown universal features which are rather material-independent, and presumably intrinsic to the pseudogap phase. The doping and temperature dependence of the Fermi arcs and the pseudogap observed by photoemission near the antinode correlates with the non-Fermi liquid behaviour observed by Raman for the B1g mode. In contrast, and similar to the nodal quasiparticles detected by photoemission, the Raman B2g mode shows Fermi liquid features. We show that these two experiments can be analysed, in the context of the t-J model, by self-energy effects in the proximity to a d-wave flux-phase order instability. This approach supports a crossover origin for the pseudogap, and a scenario of two competing phases. The B2g mode shows, in an underdoped case, a depletion at intermediate energy which has attracted renewed interest. We study this depletion and discuss its origin and relation with the pseudogap. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The structural and polar properties of BiFeO3 at finite temperature are investigated using an atomistic shell model fitted to first-principles calculations. Molecular dynamics simulations show a direct transition from the lowerature R3c ferroelectric phase to the Pbnm orthorhombic phase without evidence of any intermediate bridging phase between them. The higherature phase is characterized by the presence of two sublattices with opposite polarizations, and it displays the characteristic double-hysteresis loop under the action of an external electric field. The microscopic analysis reveals that the change in the polar direction and the large lattice strains observed during the antiferroelectric-ferroelectric phase transition originate from the interplay between polarization, oxygen octahedron rotations, and strain. As a result, the induced ferroelectric phase recovers the symmetry of the lowerature R3c phase. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

In this sense, short crack initiation and growth during low cycle fatigue (LCF) and short crack nucleation during high cycle fatigue (HCF) of this LDSS have been studied. The active slip systems and their associated Schmid factors (SF) are determined using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). Additionally, the dislocation structure developed during cycling is observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Regardless of the fatigue regime, LCF and HCF, short cracks nucleate along intrusion/extrusions in ferritic grains. Moreover, during the LCF phase boundaries decelerate short crack propagation. These results are rationalized by the hardness of the constitutive phases and the dependence of screw dislocation mobility in the ferrite phase on strain rate and stress amplitude. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We describe the method devised to reconstruct inclined cosmic-ray air showers with zenith angles greater than 60° detected with the surface array of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The measured signals at the ground level are fitted to muon density distributions predicted with atmospheric cascade models to obtain the relative shower size as an overall normalization parameter. The method is evaluated using simulated showers to test its performance. The energy of the cosmic rays is calibrated using a sub-sample of events reconstructed with both the fluorescence and surface array techniques. The reconstruction method described here provides the basis of complementary analyses including an independent measurement of the energy spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic rays using very inclined events collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.},

abstract={The surface detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory provides information about the longitudinal development of the muonic component of extensive air showers. Using the timing information from the flash analog-to-digital converter traces of surface detectors far from the shower core, it is possible to reconstruct a muon production depth distribution. We characterize the goodness of this reconstruction for zenith angles around 60° and different energies of the primary particle. From these distributions, we define Xmaxμ as the depth along the shower axis where the production of muons reaches maximum. We explore the potentiality of Xmaxμ as a useful observable to infer the mass composition of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays. Likewise, we assess its ability to constrain hadronic interaction models. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract={The lattice dynamics of Ba2CuGe2O7, a compound which develops Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya helical magnetism below TN=3.2 K, has been studied by measuring the infrared reflectivity of a single crystal with the radiation polarized both in the ab plane and along the c axis of its tetragonal cell, from 7 to 300 K. In this compound, where the unit cell has no inversion symmetry, 14 E phonon modes of the ab plane, out of the 18 predicted, and nine B2 modes of the c axis, out of the ten predicted, have been observed. They have been assigned to the atomic motions by a comparison with shell-model calculations, which provided vibrational frequencies in good agreement with the experiment, while most calculated intensities turned out to be much lower than the experimental values. This discrepancy has been tentatively explained by assuming strong electron-phonon interactions, a hypothesis supported by the failure of the f-sum rule if restricted to the phonon region. Indeed, we observe a remarkable increase in the oscillator strengths between 300 and 200 K for the phonons of the ab plane (between 300 and 100 K for the c axis), which implies an increase in the dielectric constant of Ba2CuGe2O7 below room temperature. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Quantum thermal transport in armchair and zigzag graphene nanoribbons is investigated in the presence of single atomic vacancies and subject to different boundary conditions. We start with a full comparison of the phonon polarizations and energy dispersions as given by a fifth-nearest-neighbor force-constant model (5NNFCM) and by elasticity theory of continuum membranes (ETCM). For free-edge ribbons, we discuss the behavior of an additional acoustic edge-localized flexural mode, known as fourth acoustic branch (4ZA), which has a small gap when it is obtained by the 5NNFCM. Then, we show that ribbons with supported edges have a sample-size dependent energy gap in the phonon spectrum which is particularly large for in-plane modes. Irrespective to the calculation method and the boundary condition, the dependence of the energy gap for the low-energy optical phonon modes against the ribbon width W is found to be proportional to 1/W for in-plane, and 1/W2 for out-of-plane phonon modes. Using the 5NNFCM, the ballistic thermal conductance and its contributions from every single phonon mode are then obtained by the nonequilibrium Green's function technique. We found that, while edge and central localized single atomic vacancies do not affect the low-energy transmission function of in-plane phonon modes, they reduce considerably the contributions of the flexural modes. On the other hand, in-plane modes contributions are strongly dependent on the boundary conditions and at low temperatures can be highly reduced in supported-edge samples. These findings could open a route to engineer graphene based devices where it is possible to discriminate the relative contribution of polarized phonons and to tune the thermal transport on the nanoscale. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Dynamics of the Eley-Rideal (ER) abstraction of H2 from W(110) is analyzed by means of quasi-classical trajectory calculations. Simulations are based on two different molecule-surface potential energy surfaces (PES) constructed from Density Functional Theory results. One PES is obtained by fitting, using a Flexible Periodic London-Eyring-Polanyi-Sato (FPLEPS) functional form, and the other by interpolation through the corrugation reducing procedure (CRP). Then, the present study allows us to elucidate the ER dynamics sensitivity on the PES representation. Despite some sizable discrepancies between both H+H/W(110) PESs, the obtained projectile-energy dependence of the total ER cross sections are qualitatively very similar ensuring that the main physical ingredients are captured in both PES models. The obtained distributions of the final energy among the different molecular degrees of freedom barely depend on the PES model, being most likely determined by the reaction exothermicity. Therefore, a reasonably good agreement with the measured final vibrational state distribution is observed in spite of the pressure and material gaps between theoretical and experimental conditions. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={A flux of neutrons from an astrophysical source in the Galaxy can be detected in the Pierre Auger Observatory as an excess of cosmic-ray air showers arriving from the direction of the source. To avoid the statistical penalty for making many trials, classes of objects are tested in combinations as nine "target sets," in addition to the search for a neutron flux from the Galactic center or from the Galactic plane. Within a target set, each candidate source is weighted in proportion to its electromagnetic flux, its exposure to the Auger Observatory, and its flux attenuation factor due to neutron decay. These searches do not find evidence for a neutron flux from any class of candidate sources. Tabulated results give the combined p-value for each class, with and without the weights, and also the flux upper limit for the most significant candidate source within each class. These limits on fluxes of neutrons significantly constrain models of EeV proton emission from non-transient discrete sources in the Galaxy. © 2014. The American Astronomical Society.

abstract={Measurements of air showers made using the hybrid technique developed with the fluorescence and surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory allow a sensitive search for point sources of EeV photons anywhere in the exposed sky. A multivariate analysis reduces the background of hadronic cosmic rays. The search is sensitive to a declination band from -85° to +20°, in an energy range from 1017.3 eV to 1018.5 eV. No photon point source has been detected. An upper limit on the photon flux has been derived for every direction. The mean value of the energy flux limit that results from this, assuming a photon spectral index of -2, is 0.06 eV cm-2 s -1, and no celestial direction exceeds 0.25 eV cm-2 s -1. These upper limits constrain scenarios in which EeV cosmic ray protons are emitted by non-transient sources in the Galaxy. © 2014. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

abstract={Some time ago, the Faddeev-Jackiw canonical quantization formalism for constrained systems with Grassmann dynamical variables in the field theory context was reviewed. In the present work, the resulting formalism is applied to a classical nonrelativistic U(1) ×U(1) gauge field model that describes the electromagnetic interaction of composite particles in 2+1 dimensions. The model contains a Chern-Simons U(1) field and the electromagnetic field, and it uses either a composite boson system or a composite fermion one. The obtained results are compared with the ones corresponding to the implementation of the Dirac formalism to this model, concluding that the Faddeev-Jackiw and Dirac methods cannot be considered equivalent. A simplified version of the above model is analyzed in the same way, similar to the one used within the framework of condensed matter. In this case, it is observed that when the results obtained by the Faddeev-Jackiw and Dirac methods coincide, the first method is more economical than the second one. For both models, the composite fermion case is explicitly considered. © World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) powders have been prepared by the sol-gel method using different synthesis parameters. Specifically, zirconium n-propoxide was dissolved in propanol at pH 0.5 or 5 (provided by HNO3), with or without acetic acid in the hydrolysis medium. Subsequently, the YSZ powders obtained by gelation and drying of these solutions was characterized using scanning and transmission electron microscopies, X-ray diffractometry, and N2-adsorption. Compacts made from these YSZ powders which were then sintered were also analyzed. It was found that the pH of the hydrolysis medium has a notable influence on the microstructure, morphology, color, crystallinity, and sintering behavior process of these YSZ sol-gel powders. It was also found that the use of acetic acid also affects the YSZ powder features, and results in compacts with higher residual porosity after sintering. Finally, the compacts prepared from the YSZ powders obtained at pH 5 and without acetic acid exhibit the greatest sinterability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.All rights reserved.},

abstract={Oxide-dispersion strengthened ferritic martensitic steels such as ODS-Eurofer grade are good candidates for structural applications in future fusion power reactors. Long-term annealing treatments in vacuum were carried out in cold-rolled samples (80% reduction in thickness) from 1 h up to 4320 h (6 months) at 800 °C, i.e. the maximum temperature in the ferritic phase field, to follow its softening behavior. The microstructural stability of this steel was mapped using several characterization techniques including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, Vickers microhardness testing, X-ray diffraction texture measurements, low-temperature electrical resistivity, and magnetic coercive field measurements. ODS-Eurofer steel displays good microstructural stability. Discontinuous recrystallization occurs at the early stages of annealing resulting in a low volume fraction of recrystallized grains. Extended recovery is the predominant softening mechanism at this temperature for longer times. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Hydrogen absorption occurs during steelmaking processes and causes detriment on mechanical properties, such as plasticity, fatigue strength and tensile strength, among others. The main purpose of the present paper is to study the hydrogen effects on the low cycle fatigue behaviour of a high strength steel, resulphurised and microalloyed. Before the cyclic tests, samples are cathodically charged using a H2SO4 acid solution. In some samples, poisons are added. The flow stress evolution during cycling was studied by analysing the so called 'back' and 'friction' stresses derived from the hysteresis loops. Fatigued specimens were observed through scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, the metallographic technique known as 'silver decoration' allows evaluation of the hydrogen distribution in the structure by applying energy dispersive analysis. The higher stress levels and cyclic softening rates exhibited by hydrogen charged samples in comparison with uncharged ones are related with the friction stress behaviour. The hydrogen is found mainly associated with MnS inclusions. © 2014 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.},

abstract={We study the dynamics of transient hot H atoms on Pd(100) that originated from dissociative adsorption of H2. The methodology developed here, denoted AIMDEF, consists of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations that include a friction force to account for the energy transfer to the electronic system. We find that the excitation of electron-hole pairs is the main channel for energy dissipation, which happens at a rate that is five times faster than energy transfer into Pd lattice motion. Our results show that electronic excitations may constitute the dominant dissipation channel in the relaxation of hot atoms on surfaces. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract={The emission of radio waves from air showers has been attributed to the so-called geomagnetic emission process. At frequencies around 50 MHz this process leads to coherent radiation which can be observed with rather simple setups. The direction of the electric field induced by this emission process depends only on the local magnetic field vector and on the incoming direction of the air shower. We report on measurements of the electric field vector where, in addition to this geomagnetic component, another component has been observed that cannot be described by the geomagnetic emission process. The data provide strong evidence that the other electric field component is polarized radially with respect to the shower axis, in agreement with predictions made by Askaryan who described radio emission from particle showers due to a negative charge excess in the front of the shower. Our results are compared to calculations which include the radiation mechanism induced by this charge-excess process. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

The experiments, in addition to illustrating the resonance phenomenon in a different structure of the classical mass-spring oscillator, permit measure the Young's modulus of the rod's material. In order to display the fundamental mode together with the second and third normal mode of vibration, we use a cantilever beam made of a less rigid material. This allows us to compare the shape of the beam when it vibrates in different modes, with the theoretical predictions. In particular one can observe the presence of "quasi-nodes"(or nodes with small amplitude) where the energy flow compensate for power loss. © by the Sociedade Brasileira de Física.},

abstract={In several previous investigations, we presented models of triaxial stellar systems, both cuspy and non-cuspy, that were highly stable and harboured large fractions of chaotic orbits. All our models had been obtained through cold collapses of initially spherical N-body systems, a method that necessarily results in models with strongly radial velocity distributions. Here we investigate a different method that was reported to yield cuspy triaxial models with virtually no chaos. We show that such a result was probably due to the use of an inadequate chaos detection technique and that, in fact, models with significant fractions of chaotic orbits result also from that method. Besides, starting with one of the models from the first paper in this series, we obtained three different models by rendering its velocity distribution much less radially biased (i.e. more isotropic) and by modifying its axial ratios through adiabatic compression. All three models yielded much higher fractions of regular orbits than most of those from our previous work. We conclude that it is possible to obtain stable cuspy triaxial models of stellar systems whose velocity distribution is more isotropic than that of the models obtained from cold collapses. Those models still harbour large fractions of chaotic orbits and, although it is difficult to compare the results from different models, we can tentatively conclude that chaoticity is reduced by velocity isotropy. © 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract={The melting of fluorographene is very unusual and depends strongly on the degree of fluorination. For temperatures below 1000 K, fully fluorinated graphene (FFG) is thermomechanically more stable than graphene but at T m ≈ 2800 K FFG transits to random coils which is almost 2 times lower than the melting temperature of graphene, i.e., 5300 K. For fluorinated graphene up to 30% ripples causes detachment of individual F-atoms around 2000 K, while for 40%-60% fluorination large defects are formed beyond 1500 K and beyond 60% of fluorination F-atoms remain bonded to graphene until melting. The results agree with recent experiments on the dependence of the reversibility of the fluorination process on the percentage of fluorination. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Hole-doped cuprates show a superconducting critical temperature Tc which follows a universal dome-shaped behavior as a function of doping. It is believed that the origin of superconductivity in cuprates is entangled with the physics of the pseudogap phase. An open discussion is whether the source of superconductivity is the same effect that causes the pseudogap properties. The t-J model treated in large-N expansion shows d-wave superconductivity triggered by nonretarded interactions, and an instability of the paramagnetic state to a flux phase or d-wave charge-density wave (d-CDW) state. In this paper we show that self-energy effects near the d-CDW instability may lead to a dome-shaped behavior of Tc. In addition, it is also shown that these self-energy contributions may describe several properties observed in the pseudogap phase. In this picture, although fluctuations responsible for the pseudogap properties lead to a dome-shaped behavior, they are not involved in pairing, which is mainly nonretarded. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Controlling bond-selective chemical reactivity is of great importance and has a broad range of applications. Here, we present a molecular dynamics study of bond selective reactivity of methane and its deuterated isotopologues (i.e., CH4-xDx, x=0,1,2,3,4) on Ni(111) and Pt(111) from first principles calculations. Our simulations allow for reproducing the full C-H bond selectivity recently achieved experimentally via mode-specific vibrational excitation and explain its origin. Moreover, we also predict the hitherto unexplored influence of the molecular translational energy on such a selectivity as well as the conditions under which the full selectivity can be realized for the a priori less active C-D bond. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract={We analyze the transport properties of a double quantum dot device with both dots coupled to perfect conducting leads and to a finite chain of N noninteracting sites connecting both of them. The interdot chain strongly influences the transport across the system and the local density of states of the dots. We study the case of a small number of sites, so that Kondo box effects are present, varying the coupling between the dots and the chain. For odd N and small coupling between the interdot chain and the dots, a state with two coexisting Kondo regimes develops: the bulk Kondo due to the quantum dots connected to leads and the one produced by the screening of the quantum dot spins by the spin in the finite chain at the Fermi level. As the coupling to the interdot chain increases, there is a crossover to a molecular Kondo effect, due to the screening of the molecule (formed by the finite chain and the quantum dots) spin by the leads. For even N the two Kondo temperatures regime does not develop and the physics is dominated by the usual competition between Kondo and antiferromagnetism between the quantum dots. We finally study how the transport properties are affected as N is increased. For the study we used exact multiconfigurational Lanczos calculations and finite-U slave-boson mean-field theory at T=0. The results obtained with both methods describe qualitatively and also quantitatively the same physics. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Through a systematic analysis based on DFT calculations, we have studied the adsorption of S atoms on Au(111) at low and intermediate coverages (θ ≤ 1/3). Our calculations predict ground state structures characterized by two periodicities: (5 × 5) and (√3 × √3)R30. In line with experiments, the (5 × 5) periodicity seems to dominate in a much larger coverage range than the (√3 × √3)R30 one, which should be only observable in a narrow coverage window close to 1/3. In addition, our results unambiguously reveal the crucial role of S-induced substrate relaxation. Using a first-principles parametrized lattice-gas Hamiltonian approach, we determine lateral interactions between S atoms which allow us to provide a sound explanation for the relative stability of ground state structures. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

We will introduce a formalism for this classical limit that allows us to find the surfaces defined by the constants of the motion in phase space. Then in the integrable case we will find the classical trajectories, and in the non-integrable one the fact that regular initial cells become "amoeboid-like". This deformations and their consequences can be considered as a threat to the correspondence principle unless we take into account the characteristic timescales of quantum chaos. Essentially we present an analysis of the problem similar to the one of Omnès (1994,1999), but with a simpler mathematical structure. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The Pierre Auger Observatory is making significant contributions towards understanding the nature and origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. One of its main challenges is the monitoring of the atmosphere, both in terms of its state variables and its optical properties. The aim of this work is to analyse aerosol optical depth τa(z) values measured from 2004 to 2012 at the observatory, which is located in a remote and relatively unstudied area of Pampa Amarilla, Argentina. The aerosol optical depth is in average quite low - annual mean τa(3.5km)~0.04 - and shows a seasonal trend with a winter minimum - τa(3.5km)~0.03 -, and a summer maximum - τa(3.5km)~0.06 -, and an unexpected increase from August to September - τa(3.5km)~0.055. We computed backward trajectories for the years 2005 to 2012 to interpret the air mass origin. Winter nights with low aerosol concentrations show air masses originating from the Pacific Ocean. Average concentrations are affected by continental sources (wind-blown dust and urban pollution), whilst the peak observed in September and October could be linked to biomass burning in the northern part of Argentina or air pollution coming from surrounding urban areas. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

A combination between fatigue testing of electropolished specimens and analytical electron microscopy (SEM/EBSD, TEM) revealed that under LCF loading conditions almost all the ferrite and the austenite grains showed plasticity, while under HCF and VHCF loading conditions, slip band formation was limited to the softer austenite grains and a low plastic activity is observed in the ferrite. Once being formed, the bands generate high stress concentrations, where they impinge the α-γ phase boundaries, eventually, leading to the crack initiation. This is discussed by applying a numerical simulation approach based on the finite-element (FEM) and the boundary-element (BEM) method. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To obtain ceramic samples with different porosity the sintering of pellets is carried out in air at different temperatures between 1088 and 1125°C for 2h. Structural and microstructural characterizations are performed by XRD and SEM and the degree and type of porosity is determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry. The influence of sintering temperature on the porosity and its consequence on both the ferroelectric hysteresis loops and the piezoelectric response was evaluated. The maximum densification is achieved at 1125°C and the best ferroelectric response is achieved in sintered pellets at 1125°C.

abstract={It is well-known that the characteristics of aluminum nitride thin films mainly depend on their morphologies, the quality of the film-substrate interfaces and the open volume defects. A study of the depth profiling and morphological characterization of AlN thin films deposited on two types of Si substrates is presented. Thin films of thicknesses between 200 and 400 nm were deposited during two deposition times using a reactive sputter magnetron. These films were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction and imaging techniques (SEM and TEM). To analyze the composition of the films, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was applied. Positron annihilation spectroscopy, specifically Doppler broadening spectroscopy, was used to gather information on the depth profiling of open volume defects inside the films and the AlN films-Si substrate interfaces. The results are interpreted in terms of the structural changes induced in the films as a consequence of changes in the deposition time (i.e., thicknesses) and of the orientation of the substrates. © 2014 EDP Sciences.},

The ECAP deformation followed routes A, Ay (no rotation between passes but keeping the normal to rolling direction parallel to the transverse extrusion axis) and Bc. Texture evaluation was performed by xray analysis. Results were analyzed by regular texture and orientation distribution function calculations.

abstract={The standardisation of UV information to the public through the UV Index (UVI) has been hugely beneficial since its endorsement by multiple international agencies more than 10 years ago. It has now gained widespread acceptance, and UVI values are available throughout the world from satellite instruments, ground-based measurements, and from forecasts based on model calculations. These have been useful for atmospheric scientists, health professionals (skin and eye specialists), and the general public. But the descriptors and health messages associated with the UVI scale are targeted towards European skin types and UV regimes, and are not directly applicable to the population living closer to the equator, especially for those in the high-altitude Altiplano region of South America. This document arose from discussions at the Latin American Society of Photobiology and Photomedicine's Congress, which was held in Arequipa, Peru, in November 2013. A major outcome of the meeting was the Arequipa Accord, which is intended as a unifying document to ensure co-ordination of UV and health research decisions in Latin America. A plank of that agreement was the need to tailor the UVI scale to make it more relevant to the region and its population. Here we make some suggestions to improve the international applicability of the UVI scale. © the Partner Organisations 2014.},

Our approach permits the implementation of high modulation depth (60 %), low optical loss (1.3 dB) and a 3 dB broad modulation bandwidth of 40 nm, operating in the MHz frequency range. The experimental results demonstrate that including tapered optical fibers can be regarded as an extra degree of freedom to control the optical bandwidth of the modulator.},

Accounting for the optimal parameters affecting shape memory properties, i.e., the chemical composition, the amount of processing deformation, the annealing temperature, and the correlation between the reversibility of the martensitic transformation and the conditions of the microstructure (particularly the role of crystal defects), we found that maximum recovery in a Fe-15Mn-5Si-9Cr-5Ni alloy is achieved by rolling at 800 °C followed by annealing at 650 °C. Furthermore, we investigated certain properties that establish technological feasibility limits to industrial production, including alloy weldability and mechanical response. Bending and tensile specimen tests determinate the expected behavior of parts joined by welding. We also developed an original process to produce the couplings. The degree of shape recovery of the couplings manufactured by this method depends on the annealing temperature after welding. The couplings annealed at 800 °C recovered 83% of a 3.6% permanent diametrical expansion. © 2014 ASM International.},

After this thermo-mechanical processing, the material recovers around 95% of a 3% permanent deformation excursion. This work addresses the formability and weldability of sheets processed in that manner and how welding affects the mechanical and shape memory properties. Here, the designs and verification are presented for a new method for manufacturing couplings by forming and welding, and finally, the degree of shape recovery in couplings manufactured by this new method are evaluated.

In addition, near half-filling the RSOC leads to a departure of the antiferromagnetic state of the FKLM with a consequent reduction to the intrinsic tendency to electronic phase separation. A similar behavior is observed at very low electron density in the presence of an antiferromagnetic coupling between localized spins. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The onset of Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) regime is quite instructive on the possible origins of the nano-microstructures developed in metals and alloys. It is known that grain fragmentation and dislocation accumulation, among other defects, proceed at different paces depending fundamentally on grain orientations and active deformation mechanisms. There have been many attempts to characterize nano-microstructure anisotropy, leading all of them to sometimes contradictory conclusions. Moreover, the characterizations rely on different measurements techniques and pos-processing approaches, which can be observing different manifestations of the same phenomena. On the current presentation we show a few experimental and computer pos-processing and simulation approaches, applied to some SPD/alloy systems. Williamson-Hall and Convolutional Multiple Whole Profile (CMWP) techniques will be applied to peak broadening analysis on experimental results stemming from laboratory Cu Ka X-rays, and synchrotron radiation from LNLS (Laboratório Nacional de Luz Síncrotron, Campinas, Brazil) and Petra III line (HEMS station, at DESY, Hamburg, Germany). Taking advantage of the EBSD capability of giving information on orientational and topological characteristics of grain boundaries, microstructures, grain sizes, etc., we also performed investigations on dislocation density and Geometrically Necessary Dislocation Boundaries (GNDB) and their correlation with texture components. Orientation dependent nano-microstructures and domain sizes are shown on the scheme of generalized pole figures and discussions provide some hints on nano-microstructure anisotropy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The spatiotemporal evolution of the object phase is isolated by modulating the acquired interferometric intensity signals with a known temporal carrier in order to carry out its analysis by using a bivariate empirical mode decomposition framework that avoids the application of the Hilbert transform, which is not suitable for intensity signals with abrupt fluctuations. The advantages and limitations of this technique are analyzed and discussed by comparing computation time and phase recovery capability with well-known phase-retrieval methods by means of numerical simulations and experimental data. © 2014 Optical Society of America},

abstract={Plants are continuously exposed to atmospheric particulate matter (dust), and their leaves are the main receptors of deposited dust. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of dust deposition on leaf gas exchange parameters of 17 native and non-native tree and shrub species growing in Gran San Miguel de Tucumán in northwestern Argentina. Maximum assimilation rate (Amax), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration rate (E), internal CO2 concentration (Ci), and instantaneous water-use efficiency (WUE) were measured in cleaned leaves (CL) and dusted leaves (DL) of different species on November 2010, July 2011, and September 2011. In almost all studied species, gas exchange parameters were significantly affected by dust deposition. Values for Amax, E, and gs of DL were significantly reduced in 11, 12, and 14 species compared with CL. Morphological leaf traits seem to be related to Amax reduction. Indeed, Mespilus germanica L. and Tabebuia chrysotricha (Mart. ex DC.) Standl. species with pubescent leaves and thick ribs showed the highest reduction percentages. Contrarily, Ci and WUE were increased in DL but were less responsive to dust deposition than other parameters. Increases of Ci and WUE were significant in 5 and 11 species, respectively. Correlation analyses between Amax/gs, Amax/E, and E/gs pairs showed significant positive linear correlations in CL and DL of many studied species, including small and tall plants. These results suggest that leaf stomatal factors and shade-induced effect by accumulated dust are primarily responsible for the observed reductions in photosynthesis rate of DL. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.},

abstract={Encapsulation of albendazole, a class II compound, into polymeric microparticles based on chitosan-sodium lauryl sulfate was investigated as a strategy to improve drug dissolution and oral bioavailability. The microparticles were prepared by spray drying technique and further characterized by means of X-ray powder diffractometry, infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The formation of a novel polymeric structure between chitosan and sodium lauryl sulfate, after the internal or external gelation process, was observed by infrared spectroscopy. The efficiency of encapsulation was found to be between 60 and 85% depending on the internal or external gelation process. Almost spherically spray dried microparticles were observed using scanning electron microscopy. In vitro dissolution results indicated that the microparticles prepared by internal gelation released 8% of the drug within 30min, while the microparticles prepared by external gelation released 67% within 30min. It was observed that the AUC and Cmax values of ABZ from microparticles were greatly improved, in comparison with the non-encapsulated drug. In conclusion, the release properties and oral bioavailability of albendazole were greatly improved by using spraydried chitosan-sodium lauryl sulphate microparticles. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

The ECAP deformation followed routes A, Ay (no rotation between passes but keeping the normal to rolling direction parallel to the transverse extrusion axis) and Bc. Texture evaluation was performed by xray analysis. Results were analyzed by regular texture and orientation distribution function calculations.

abstract={A time-of-flight (TOF) neutron strain scanner is a white-beam instrument optimized to measure diffractograms at precise locations within bulky specimens, typically along two perpendicular sample orientations. Here, a method is proposed that exploits the spatial resolution (∼1emmm) provided by such an instrument to determine in a nondestructive manner the crystallographic texture at selected locations within a macroscopic object. The method is based on defining the orientation distribution function (ODF) of the crystallites from several incomplete pole figures, and it has been implemented on ENGIN-X, a neutron strain scanner at the ISIS facility in the UK. This method has been applied to determine the texture at different locations of Al alloy plates welded along the rolling direction and to study a Zr2.5%Nb pressure tube produced for a CANDU nuclear power plant. For benchmarking, the results obtained with this instrument for samples of ferritic steel, copper, Al alloys and Zr alloys have been compared with measurements performed using conventional X-ray diffractometers and more established neutron techniques. For cases where pole figure coverage is incomplete, the use of TOF neutron transmission measurements simultaneously performed on the specimens is proposed as a simple and powerful test to validate the resulting ODF. © 2014 International Union of Crystallography.},

They allow the measurement of several parameters of interest, such as the electron density and temperature, as well as the determination of the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) by numerical derivation of the characteristic V-I [4] or by probe-current modulation [5]. In this work, some second positive system bands in the negative glow of an Ar-N2 plasma at a pressure of 2.5 Torr were investigated both by OES and Langmuir probes, for different mixture concentrations. The main purpose of this study was to verify how metastable states and the behavior of the EEDF may influence the interpretation of OES data.},

In particular, we study the structural and piezoelectric properties of LixK 1-xNbO3 which is taken as a prototypical solid solution. We show that the system develops an orthorhombic to tetragonal polymorphic phase transition at room temperature for a Li concentration of 4.5%. We showed that not only the phase coexistence region is relevant for the enhancement of the piezoelectric properties but also the off-center Li impurities play an important role in the improvement of the electromechanical response. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={We have precisely measured absolute double differential cross sections (DDCSs) for secondary electron emission produced in collisions of 6.0 MeV u -1 C6+ and C4+ ions with water vapor. Theoretical calculations of the DDCSs were made for C6+ ions using the continuum distorted wave-eikonal initial state model (CDW-EIS) in its straight-line version of the impact parameter approximation, showing general good agreement with experimental data, except in the intermediate- and high-energy region (&gt; 50 eV), particularly at the backward angles (&gt; 110°). On the other hand, the single differential cross section (SDCS), which was obtained by integrating the measured DDCSs over the solid angle, showed fairly good agreement with the CDW-EIS in the low-energy region (&lt; 200 eV), while a significant discrepancy between the observed SDCS and the Rudd-model scaling (× 36) can be seen, suggesting that a simple Z 2-scaling law (i.e. first Born approximation) is not applicable for high-Z bare projectiles such as C6+ ions. The SDCS of C4+ ions was observed to be smaller than that of C6+ ions by ∼ 50% in the low-energy region (&lt; 200 eV) due to the screening effect of its bound electrons in C4+ ions, which could be explained quantitatively by taking account of an effective projectile charge. © 2013 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={We study the occurrence of symmetry breaking, at zero and finite temperatures, in the J1-J3 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the square lattice using Schwinger boson mean field theory. For spin- the ground state always breaks the SU(2) symmetry with a continuous quasi-critical transition at J3/J1 ∼ 0.38, from Néel to spiral long range order, although local spin fluctuation considerations suggest an intermediate disordered regime around 0.35 ≲ J3/J1 ≲ 0.5, in qualitative agreement with recent numerical results. At low temperatures we find a Z2 broken symmetry region with short range spiral order characterized by an Ising-like nematic order parameter that compares qualitatively well with classical Monte Carlo results. At intermediate temperatures the phase diagram shows regions with collinear short range orders: for J3/J1 &lt; 1 Néel (π,π) correlations and for J3/J1 &gt; 1 a novel phase consisting of four decoupled third neighbour sublattices with Néel (π,π) correlations in each one. We conclude that the effect of quantum and thermal fluctuations is to favour collinear correlations even in the strongly frustrated regime. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={We analyze the time evolution of a magnetic excitation in a spin-12 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain after a quantum quench. By a proper modulation of the magnetic exchange coupling, we prepare a static soliton of total spin 12 as an initial spin state. Using bosonization and a numerical time-dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithm, we show that the initial excitation evolves to a state composed of two counterpropagating chiral states, which interfere to yield for each mode. We find that these dynamically generated states remain considerably stable as time evolution is carried out. We propose spin-Peierls materials and ultracold-atom systems as suitable experimental scenarios in which to conduct and observe this mechanism. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract={In the present work, a study on the dependence of the Dielectric Strength (DS) as a function of the empty space and the internal stresses into polymer samples has been performed. The empty space was measured by means of positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. The internal stresses into the polymer matrix, due to the appearance of the crystalline zones, were determined by applying the inclusion theory results to the dynamic mechanical analysis measurements. Attention to the effect of the chain movement on the electrical breakdown process has been paid. The study has been performed at a mesoscopic scale with the aim of demonstrating the influence of the thermal, mechanical or electrical stresses on the chains movement and their effect on the dielectric breakdown phenomenon. It has been verified that, DS is a function of the empty space into the sample and also of the internal stresses acting at the polymer chains, which result from the crystalline state promoted by chemicrystallization. The empty space decrease and the internal stresses act overlapped against the electrical force operating on the polymer chains. It is deduced from the work, that the precursor phenomenon for the electrical breakdown is the bend of polymer chains, prior to the onset of their collective movement promoted by the electrical forces. © 1994-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The dissociative adsorption of molecular hydrogen on PdxRu 1-x/Ru(0001) (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) has been investigated by means of He atom scattering, Density Functional Theory and quasi-classical trajectory calculations. Regardless of their surroundings, Pd atoms in the alloy are always less reactive than Ru ones. However, the reactivity of Ru atoms is enhanced by the presence of nearest neighbor Pd atoms. This environment-dependent reactivity of the Ru atoms in the alloy provides a sound explanation for the striking step-like dependence of the initial reactive sticking probability as a function of the Pd concentration observed in experiments. Moreover, we show that these environment-dependent effects on the reactivity of H2 on single atoms allow one to get around the usual constraint imposed by the Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relationship between the reaction barrier and chemisorption energy. © the Owner Societies 2013.},

abstract={Ionization and fragmentation of uracil molecules (C4H 4N2O2, m = 112 amu) in collisions with fast highly charged C, O and F ions have been investigated using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The measurement of total ionization cross sections (TCS) is reported for different charge states (q), such as Fq + with q = 5-8; Oq + with q = 5,7; Cq + with q = 5 and 6. These studies reveal a (q/v)∼1.5 dependence of TCS, in contrast, to the well-known q2-dependence in ion-atom collisions. Scaling properties of the TCS with projectile energy and charge states are obtained. The experimental results for TCS measurements are compared with the theoretical calculations performed within classical and quantum mechanical frameworks. The trends in energy dependence of the TCSs is qualitatively well reproduced by the different models and more specifically by the classical description, which provides the best agreement with measurements. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Using first-principles molecular dynamics (AIMD) and constrained density functional theory (CDFT) we identify the pathway of primary electron transfer in the R. Sphaeroides reaction center from the special pair excited state (P*) to the accessory bacteriochlorophyll (BA). Previous AIMD simulations on the special pair (PLPM) predicted a charge-transfer intermediate formation through the excited-state relaxation along a reaction coordinate characterized by the rotation of an axial histidine (HisM202). To account for the full electron transfer we extend the model to include the primary acceptor BA. In this extended model, the LUMO is primarily localized on the acceptor BA and extends over an interstitial water (water A) that is known to influence the rate of electron transfer (Potter et al. Biochemistry 2005 280, 27155-27164). A vibrational analysis of the dynamical trajectories gives a frequency of 30-35 cm -1 for a molecular motion involving the hydrogen-bond network around water A, in good agreement with experimental findings (Yakovlev et al. Biochemistry, 2003, 68, 603-610). In its binding pocket water A can act as a switch by breaking and forming hydrogen bonds. With CDFT we calculate the energy required to the formation of the charge-separated state and find it to decrease along the predicted anisotropic reaction coordinate. Furthermore, we observe an increased coupling between the ground and charge-separated state. Water A adapts its hydrogen-bonding network along this reaction coordinate and weakens the hydrogen bond with HisM202. We also present AIMD simulations on the radical cation (P•+) showing a weakening of the hydrogen bond between HisL168 and the 31-acetyl of PL. This work demonstrates how proton displacements are crucially coupled to the primary electron transfer and characterizes the reaction coordinate of the initial photoproduct formation. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

The gelation rate of NaCAS related to the amount of GDL was evaluated. Also, the effect of the presence of NaCAS hydrolysates obtained at different hydrolysis times by the enzyme of Bacillus sp.

The gel images were obtained by conventional optical microscopy and texture parameters were obtained by using specific programs which were developed in Python language. Shannon entropy, smoothness, mean normalized grey-level variance and uniformity were analyzed as estimators of the texture of the images obtained. Results obtained in the evaluated systems showed that these parameters were able to represent the structural changes in the gel network, as changes in size of pores or in degree of compactness.

abstract={At half doping, the ground state of three-dimensional manganite perovskite oxides like R1-xCax MnO3, where R is a trivalent ion such as La, Pr, etc., is still unclear. Many experimental findings agree better with the combined magnetic, charge, and orbital order characteristic of the 'intermediate phase', introduced by Efremov et al.in 2004 [Nat. Mater., 3, 853]. This phase consists of spin dimers (thus incorporating aspects of the Zener polaron phase (ZP) proposed in 2002 by Daoud-Aladine et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett., 89, 097205]), though formed by a pair of parallel Mn spins of different magnitude, in principle (thereby allowing for a degree of Mn charge disproportionation: not necessarily as large as that of Mn3+ -Mn4+ in Goodenough's original CE phase [Phys. Rev. 100, 564 (1955)]). In the intermediate phase, consecutive spin dimers localed along the planar zig-zag chains are oriented at a constant relative angle φ between them. Varying Mn-charge disproportionation and φ, the intermediate phase should allow to continuously interpolate between the two limiting cases of the CE phase and the dimer phase denoted as 'orthogonal intermediate π/2-phase'. It is not easy to find a microscopic model able to describe the phenomenological intermediate phase adequately for the spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom simultaneously. Here, we study the quantum spin excitations of a planar model of interacting localized spins, which we found can stabilize the intermediate phase classically. We compare the quantum magnons of the intermediate phase with those of the CE and orthogonal π/2 phases, in the context of recent experimental results. © 1965-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={To increase the hardness of ion-nitrided stainless steels, a plastic deformation is performed previously to the nitriding treatment in order to generate dislocations used afterwards as diffusion paths for atoms. In this work, influence of different plastic strain rates on the surface hardness improvement is studied. To obtain hardness values very close to the outer surface is not possible by classical hardness-depth profile, a simple model based on indentations performed perpendicularly to the surface is proposed. The predicted hardness-depth profile in different situations of work-hardening clearly demonstrates the efficiency of the prior plastic deformation on the global hardness improvement of the nitrided stainless steel. As a result, the hardened layer thickness increases from 20 μm to 35 μm when the plastic deformation rate increases from 0% to 80% of the maximum one. This is directly linked to the augmentation of the dislocation density by the work-hardening process. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The competition between on-site Coulomb repulsion and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) is studied on two-leg ladders by numerical techniques. By studying persistent currents in closed rings by exact diagonalization, it is found that the contribution to the current due to the RSOC VSO, for a fixed value of the Hubbard repulsion U reaches a maximum at intermediate values of VSO. By increasing the repulsive Hubbard coupling U, this spin-flipping current is suppressed and eventually it becomes opposite to the spin-conserving current. The main result is that the spin accumulation defined as the relative spin polarization between the two legs of the ladder is enhanced by U. Similar results for this Hubbard-Rashba model are observed for a completely different setup in which two halves of the ladders are connected to a voltage bias and the ensuing time-dependent regime is studied by the density matrix renormalization group technique. The combined effect between V SO and U is also interesting, leading to a strong enhancement of antiferromagnetic order, which in turn may explain the observed behavior of the spin-flipping current. The implications of this enhancement of the spin-Hall effect with electron correlations for spintronic devices is discussed. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Modern to Pleistocene Amiantis purpurata shells collected in Bahía San Antonio (Patagonia, Argentina) were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical and electron microscopy, electron microprobe analyses, and microindentation, in order to characterize early diagenetic changes and mechanical resistance. The sole crystalline phase is twinned aragonite showing pseudohexagonal symmetry. The regularity of the crystallographic texture decreases in older samples, but average crystallite size does not increase. The microstructure, which is dominantly crossed lamellar, is progressively replaced by a more randomly oriented grain aggregate. Compositional profiles across the shell show gradients in Sr, Na, S, and Cl, whereas Mg and P are more evenly distributed. Each shell layer has a distinct chemical signature. A marked decrease in the concentration of all of these elements, along with flattening of profiles, is evident as age increases. Vickers microhardness is lowest in modern specimens, showing at the same time the least chipped regions; older shells become harder and more fragile. All of these changes are attributed to postdepositional modifications by dissolution-recrystallization processes mediated by a thin film of water in a vadose environment. Microstructural adjustments are more sluggish than chemical modifications produced by diagenetic processes, whereas microhardness rapidly reaches high values, probably due to the early degradation of organic compounds from the shell. Our study shows that aragonitic shells that retain their primary mineralogical composition have undergone subtle chemical and microstructural changes. A very small amount of calcite was produced during grinding for XRD. Care should therefore be taken when seeking calcite as evidence of diagenetic changes. © 2013 SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).},

abstract={In Fe-Mn-Si alloys, the shape memory effect (SME) is related to a stress-induced martensitic transformation. The transformation proceeds from the austenite phase, normally retained at room temperature, to a hexagonal-close-packed martensite: (FCC) → (HCP). However, when ribbons of a Fe-14Mn-6Si-8Cr-5.5Ni alloy are manufactured by rapid solidification, the high temperature ferritic phase can be retained. As a consequence, not only decreases the materials capacity to recover its shape, but weakens the material, as well. In melt-spinning techniques, the thickness of the ribbons as well as the stable or metastable phases that result from the process, depend mainly on the gas ejection pressure, liquid temperature, and wheel temperature and rotation speed. In this work, we used optical microscopy and transmission and scanning electron microscopy, to investigate the microstructures obtained for various melt-spinning process variables. We also analyzed the effect of heat treatments applied in order to stabilize the austenite at room temperature and to optimize the shape memory behavior.},

abstract={The effects of lithium and tantalum doping on the properties of Na 0.5K0.5NbO3 (NKN) thin films were investigated. The films were fabricated by an optimized chelate route which offers the advantage of a simple and rapid solution synthesis. The optimization was achieved by investigating the effects of alkaline volatilization loss on film properties. In this way, undoped NKN thin films fabricated by this conventional method exhibited good ferroelectric properties (Pr ~ 8 μC/cm 2, and Ec ~ 55 kV/cm for films annealed at 650 C). The developed chelate route was then used to grow Li (5 %) and Ta (10 %) substituted thin films. Such structures allowed us to compare the effect of these dopant cations on phase formation, microstructure and ferroelectric properties. We show that both modifications produced a remarkable improvement on the ferroelectricity of the films. While the undoped material exhibited large leakage components in films annealed at 600 C, films modified with Li or Ta presented well saturated ferroelectric hysteresis loops, indicating that those ions have a significant influence on the conducting process. The remnant polarizations of the Ta-doped films are greater than those of the Li-doped samples. This feature is however reversed for films annealed at low temperature (600 C) due to the presence of a non-ferroelectric secondary phase in the Ta-doped composition. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Purpose: The LIonTrack (Light Ion Track) Monte Carlo (MC) code for the simulation of H+, He2+, and other light ions in liquid water is presented together with the results of a novel investigation of energy-deposition site properties from single ion tracks. Methods: The continuum distorted-wave formalism with the eikonal initial state approximation (CDW-EIS) is employed to generate the initial energy and angle of the electrons emitted in ionizing collisions of the ions with H2O molecules. The model of Dingfelder ["Electron inelastic-scattering cross sections in liquid water," Radiat. Phys. Chem. 53, 1-18 (1998)10.1016/S0969-806X(97)00317-4; Dingfelder "Comparisons of calculations with PARTRAC and NOREC: Transport of electrons in liquid water," Radiat. Res. 169, 584-594 (2008)10.1667/RR1099.1] is linked to the general-purpose MC code PENELOPE/penEasy to simulate the inelastic interactions of the secondary electrons in liquid water. In this way, the extended PENELOPE/penEasy code may provide an improved description of the 3D distribution of energy deposits (EDs), making it suitable for applications at the micrometer and nanometer scales. Results: Single-ionization cross sections calculated with the ab initio CDW-EIS formalism are compared to available experimental values, some of them reported very recently, and the theoretical electronic stopping powers are benchmarked against those recommended by the ICRU. The authors also analyze distinct aspects of the spatial patterns of EDs, such as the frequency of nearest-neighbor distances for various radiation qualities, and the variation of the mean specific energy imparted in nanoscopic targets located around the track. For 1 MeV/u particles, the C6+ ions generate about 15 times more clusters of six EDs within an ED distance of 3 nm than H+. Conclusions: On average clusters of two to three EDs for 1 MeV/u H+ and clusters of four to five EDs for 1 MeV/u C6+ could be expected for a modeling double strand break distance of 3.4 nm. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

abstract={Using atomistic simulations we investigate the thermodynamical properties of a single atomic layer of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The thermal induced ripples, heat capacity, and thermal lattice expansion of large scale h-BN sheets are determined and compared to those found for graphene (GE) for temperatures up to 1000 K. By analyzing the mean-square height fluctuations âŒ©h2âŒ and the height-height correlation function H(q) we found that the h-BN sheet is a less stiff material as compared to graphene. The bending rigidity of h-BN (i) is about 16% smaller than the one of GE at room temperature (300 K), and (ii) increases with temperature as in GE. The difference in stiffness between h-BN and GE results in unequal responses to external uniaxial and shear stress and different buckling transitions. In contrast to a GE sheet, the buckling transition of a h-BN sheet depends strongly on the direction of the applied compression. The molar heat capacity, thermal-expansion coefficient, and Gruneisen parameter are estimated to be 25.2 J mol-1 K-1, 7.2×10-6 K-1, and 0.89, respectively. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract={The observation of ultrahigh energy neutrinos (UHEs) has become a priority in experimental astroparticle physics. UHEs can be detected with a variety of techniques. In particular, neutrinos can interact in the atmosphere (downward-going ) or in the Earth crust (Earth-skimming ), producing air showers that can be observed with arrays of detectors at the ground. With the surface detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory we can detect these types of cascades. The distinguishing signature for neutrino events is the presence of very inclined showers produced close to the ground (i.e., after having traversed a large amount of atmosphere). In this work we review the procedure and criteria established to search for UHEs in the data collected with the ground array of the Pierre Auger Observatory. This includes Earth-skimming as well as downward-going neutrinos. No neutrino candidates have been found, which allows us to place competitive limits to the diffuse flux of UHEs in the EeV range and above. © 2013 P. Abreu et al.},

abstract={We analyze the thermal fluctuations of a narrow graphene nanoribbon. Using a continuum membranelike model in the harmonic approximation, we study the height-height correlation functions and the destabilization modes corresponding to two different boundary conditions: fixed and free edges. For the first case, the thermal spectrum has a gap and the correlations along the ribbon decay exponentially. Thermal fluctuations produce only local perturbations of the flat situation. However, the long range crystalline order is not distorted. For free edges the situation changes as thermal excitations are gapless. The low energy spectrum decouples into a bulk and an edge excitation. The bulk excitation tends to destabilize the crystalline order producing a homogeneous rippling. Furthermore, we can relate the edge mode to a precluding perturbation leading to scrolled edges, as seen in suspended graphene samples. We also analyze the implications of our results in the thermal conductivity of graphene nanoribbons. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract={The pressure dependences of the structural, thermoelastic and vibrational properties of SnO2 in its rutile phase are studied, as well as the pressure-induced transition to a CaCl2-type phase. These studies have been performed by means of ab initio (AI) density functional theory calculations using the localized basis code SIESTA. The results are employed to develop a shell model (SM) for application in future studies of nanostructured SnO2. A good agreement of the SM results for the pressure dependences of the above properties with the ones obtained from present and previous AI calculations as well as from experiments is achieved. The transition is characterized by a rotation of the Sn-centered oxygen octahedra around the tetragonal axis through the Sn. This rotation breaks the tetragonal symmetry of the lattice and an orthorhombic distortion appears above the critical pressure Pc. A zone-center phonon of B1g symmetry in the rutile phase involves such rotation and softens on approaching Pc. It becomes an Ag mode which stabilizes with increasing pressure in the CaCl2 phase. This behavior, together with the softening of the shear modulus (C11-C12)/2 related to the orthorhombic distortion, allows a precise determination of a value for Pc. An additional determination is provided by the splitting of the basal plane lattice parameters. Both the AI and the experimentally observed softening of the B 1g mode are incomplete, indicating a small discontinuity at the transition. However, all results show continuous changes in volume and lattice parameters, indicating a second-order transition. All these results indicate that there should be sufficient confidence for the future employment of the shell model. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The adsorption and vibrational frequency of CO on defective and undefective titanium dioxide surfaces is examined applying first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, the vibrational frequencies are obtained beyond the harmonic approximation, through the time correlation functions of the atomic trajectories. In agreement with experiments, at low CO coverages we find an upshift in the vibration frequency with respect to the free CO molecule, of 45 and 35 cm-1 on the stoichiometric rutile (110) and anatase (101) faces, respectively. A band falling 8 cm-1 below the frequency corresponding to the perfect face is observed for the reduced rutile (110) surface in the low vacancy concentration limit, where the adsorption is favored on Ti4 sites. At a higher density of defects, adsorption on Ti 3 sites becomes more stable, accompanied by a downshift in the stretching band. In the case of anatase (101), we analyze the effect of subsurface oxygen vacancies, which have been shown to be predominant in this material. Interestingly, we find that the adsorption of CO on five coordinate Ti atoms placed over subsurface vacancies is favored with respect to other Ti 4 sites (7.25 against 6.95 kcal/mol), exhibiting a vibrational redshift of 20 cm-1. These results provide the basis to quantitatively assess the degree of reduction of rutile and anatase surfaces via IR spectroscopy, and at the same time allow for the assignment of characteristic bands in the CO spectra on TiO2 whose origin has remained ambiguous. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.},

We propose a microscopic model that explains, for all experimentally analyzed interatomic distances, the physics observed in these experiments. Our proposal is based on the two-impurity Anderson model, with the inclusion of a two-path geometry for charge transport. This many-body system is treated in the finite-U slave boson mean-field approximation and the logarithmic-discretization embedded-cluster approximation. We physically characterize the different charge transport regimes of this system at various interatomic distances and show that, as in the experiments, the features observed in the transport properties depend on the presence of two impurities but also on the existence of two conducting channels for electron transport. We interpret the splitting observed in the conductance as the result of the hybridization of the two Kondo resonances associated with each impurity. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

The goals of this work were to find the appropriate heat treatment in order to recover the equilibrium austenitic phase, characterize the ribbon form of this material and evaluate its shape memory behaviour. We found that annealing at 1050oC for 60 min, under a protective argon atmosphere, followed by a water quenching stabilizes the austenite to room temperature. The yield stress, measured by tensile tests, is 250 MPa. Shapememory tests show that a strain recovery of 55% can be obtained, which is enough for certain applications. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={In the first paper of this series we used the N-body method to build a dozen cuspy (1) triaxial models of stellar systems, and we showed that they were highly stable over time intervals of the order of a Hubble time, even though they had very large fractions of chaotic orbits (more than 85 per cent in some cases). The models were grouped in four sets, each one comprising models morphologically resembling E2, E3, E4 and E5 galaxies, respectively. The three models within each set, although different, had the same global properties and were statistically equivalent. In the present paper we use frequency analysis to classify the regular orbits of those models. The bulk of those orbits are short-axis tubes, with a significant fraction of long-axis tubes (LATs) in the E2 models that decreases in the E3 and E4 models to become negligibly small in the E5 models. Most of the LATs in the E2 and E3 models are outer LATs, but the situation reverses in the E4 and E5 models where the few LATs are mainly inner LATs. As could be expected for cuspy models, most of the boxes are resonant orbits, i.e. boxlets. Nevertheless, only the (x, y) fishes of models E3 and E4 amount to about 10 per cent of the regular orbits, with most of the fractions of the other boxlets being of the order of 1 per cent or less. © 2012 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract={Duplex Stainless Steels (DSSs) are chromium-nickel-molybdenum-iron alloys that are usually in proportions optimized for equalizing the volume fractions of austenite and ferrite. Due to their ferritic-austenitic microstructure, they possess a higher mechanical strength and a better corrosion resistance than standard austenitic steels. This type of steel is now increasing its application and market field due to its very good properties and relatively low cost. This book is a review of the most recent progress achieved in the last 10 years on microstructure, corrosion resistance and mechanical strength properties, as well as applications, due to the development of new grades. Special attention will be given to fatigue and fracture behavior and to proposed models to account for mechanical behavior. Each subject will be developed in chapters written by experts recognized around the international industrial and scientific communities. The use of duplex stainless steels has grown rapidly in the last 10 years, particularly in the oil and gas industry, chemical tankers, pulp and paper as well as the chemical industry. In all these examples, topics like welding, corrosion resistance and mechanical strength properties (mainly in the fatigue domain) are crucial. Therefore, the update of welding and corrosion properties and the introduction of topics like texture effects, fatigue and fracture strength properties, and mechanical behavior modeling give this book specific focus and character. © ISTE Ltd 2009.},

abstract={Accurate modeling of DNA damages resulting from ionizing radiation remains a challenge of today's radiobiology research. An original set of physics processes has been recently developed for modeling the detailed transport of protons and neutral hydrogen atoms in liquid water and in DNA nucleobases using the Geant4-DNA extension of the open source Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit. The theoretical cross sections as well as the mean energy transfers during the different ionizing processes were taken from recent works based on classical as well as quantum mechanical predictions. Furthermore, in order to compare energy deposition patterns in liquid water and DNA material, we here propose a simplified cellular nucleus model made of spherical voxels, each containing randomly oriented nanometer-size cylindrical targets filled with either liquid water or DNA material (DNA nucleobases) both with a density of 1 g/cm3. These cylindrical volumes have dimensions comparable to genetic material units of mammalian cells, namely, 25 nm (diameter) × 25 nm (height) for chromatin fiber segments, 10 nm (d) × 5 nm (h) for nucleosomes and 2 nm (d) × 2 nm (h) for DNA segments.

We examine the goodness of this simple method through simulations of test mass distributions.

abstract={Expanded austenite can be generated on austenitic stainless steels either by ion carburizing or ion nitriding. In both cases the resulting fcc crystal structure, supersaturated with nitrogen or carbon, is strongly hardened with improved wear-resistance, while maintaining the original resistance to corrosion. In this work, we have studied the stability of expanded austenite, generated by ion nitriding and ion carburizing on AISI 316L SS with N and C, under: a-high temperature (225 °C - 504 °C), and b-under irradiation with high energy (30 keV - 500 keV), high fluence (~1015 cm-2), short duration (~400 ns) light (deuterium and helium) ion beams. It was found that expanded austenite is stable below 325 °C. Between 325 °C and 504 °C expanded austenite lattice parameter presents gradual reductionwith increasing temperature.We observedmicrostructural changes related only to the temperature treatment. We did not observe any microstructure change due to the duration of the heat treatment. Over 504 °C, the lattice parameter returns to the material's austenite original parameter. On the other hand,when irradiated with pulsed ion beams, a gradual reduction of the lattice parameter corresponding to the expanded austenite with the number of pulseswas observed. This behavior can be explained through the thermal shock induced on the surface by each beam, consisting in fast heating followed by fast cooling that induces the gradual exo-diffusion ofN(or C).Nevertheless, after 20 ion pulses, a final lattice parameter slightly higher than the corresponding to the original austenite was found as stable limit. This residual expansion can be attributed to partial amorphization of the first few micrometers that induces stresses on the crystals of austenite which are closer to the surface layers. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We present new experimental and theoretical results for reactive scattering of dihydrogen from Cu(100). In the new experiments, the associative desorption of H2 is studied in a velocity resolved and final rovibrational state selected manner, using time-of-flight techniques in combination with resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization laser detection. Average desorption energies and rotational quadrupole alignment parameters were obtained in this way for a number of (v = 0, 1) rotational states, v being the vibrational quantum number. Results of quantum dynamics calculations based on a potential energy surface computed with a specific reaction parameter (SRP) density functional, which was derived earlier for dihydrogen interacting with Cu(111), are compared with the results of the new experiments and with the results of previous molecular beam experiments on sticking of H2 and on rovibrationally elastic and inelastic scattering of H2 and D 2 from Cu(100). The calculations use the Born-Oppenheimer and static surface approximations. With the functional derived semi-empirically for dihydrogen + Cu(111), a chemically accurate description is obtained of the molecular beam experiments on sticking of H2 on Cu(100), and a highly accurate description is obtained of rovibrationally elastic and inelastic scattering of D2 from Cu(100) and of the orientational dependence of the reaction of (v = 1, j = 2 - 4) H2 on Cu(100). This suggests that a SRP density functional derived for H2 interacting with a specific low index face of a metal will yield accurate results for H2 reactively scattering from another low index face of the same metal, and that it may also yield accurate results for H2 interacting with a defected (e.g., stepped) surface of that same metal, in a system of catalytic interest. However, the description that was obtained of the average desorption energies, of rovibrationally elastic and inelastic scattering of H2 from Cu(100), and of the orientational dependence of reaction of (v = 0, j = 3 - 5, 8) H2 on Cu(100) compares less well with the available experiments. More research is needed to establish whether more accurate SRP-density functional theory dynamics results can be obtained for these observables if surface atom motion is added to the dynamical model. The experimentally and theoretically found dependence of the rotational quadrupole alignment parameter on the rotational quantum number provides evidence for rotational enhancement of reaction at low translational energies. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={With the more and more regular use of ionizing radiations in medicine and more particularly in hadrontherapy, it is today necessary to describe-with the highest degree of accuracy-the biological consequences of irradiations. To model the track-structure of charged particles in biological matter and then to quantify the full spectra of radio-induced cellular damages, Monte Carlo simulations are the preferential methods. The latter consist in modelling the history of the ionizing particles by means of a large set of input data, namely, the differential and total interaction cross sections in order to finely describe the complete kinematics of the ion-induced collisions. In these conditions, we clearly understand the necessity for the radiobiologists and the radiotherapists to access to accurate cross sections-in particular for collisions with water target-the latter being commonly used as surrogate of the cellular medium. We here report a review of the existing 1st Born predictions for describing the ionization and the charge transfer processes in the high-impact energy-regime particularly investigated in hadrontherapy. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Recent neutron scattering experiments addressing the magnetic state of the two-leg-ladder selenide compound BaFe2Se3 have unveiled a dominant spin arrangement involving ferromagnetically ordered 2×2 iron superblocks, that are antiferromagnetically coupled among them (the ''block-AFM''state). Using the electronic five-orbital Hubbard model first-principles techniques to calculate the electronic hopping amplitudes between irons, and the real-space Hartree-Fock approximation to handle the many-body effects, here it is shown that the exotic block-AFM state is indeed stable at realistic electronic densities close to n∼6.0. Another state with parallel spins along the rungs and antiparallel along the legs of the ladders (the "CX" state) is close in energy. This state becomes stable in other portions of the phase diagrams, such as with hole doping, as also found experimentally via neutron scattering applied to KFe2Se3. In addition, the present study unveils other competing magnetic phases that could be experimentally stabilized by varying either n chemically or the electronic bandwidth by pressure. Similar results were obtained using two-orbital models, studied here via Lanczos and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques. A comparison of the results obtained with the realistic selenides hopping amplitudes for BaFe2Se3 against those found using the hopping amplitudes for pnictides reveals several qualitative similarities, particularly at intermediate and large Hubbard couplings. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

The designed reactor allows for the control and precise variation of the relevant processing parameters, namely, magnetron target-to-sample distance, dc magnetron voltage, and nature of the gas mixture, gas pressure and temperature of the substrate. On the other hand, the chamber can be used in different X-ray diffraction scanning modes, namely, θ-2θ scanning, fixed α-2θ scanning, and also low angle techniques such as grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering and X-ray reflectivity.

abstract={A thorough search for large-scale anisotropies in the distribution of arrival directions of cosmic rays detected above 1018 eV at the Pierre Auger Observatory is reported. For the first time, these large-scale anisotropy searches are performed as a function of both the right ascension and the declination and expressed in terms of dipole and quadrupole moments. Within the systematic uncertainties, no significant deviation from isotropy is revealed. Upper limits on dipole and quadrupole amplitudes are derived under the hypothesis that any cosmic ray anisotropy is dominated by such moments in this energy range. These upper limits provide constraints on the production of cosmic rays above 1018 eV, since they allow us to challenge an origin from stationary galactic sources densely distributed in the galactic disk and emitting predominantly light particles in all directions. © 2013.

abstract={Previous studies have shown that A. lumbricoides extracts capture sialic acid (SA) from human red blood cells (RBC). The aim of this work was to study hemorheological alterations in vitro caused by parasite larvae. The biorheological action of three larva concentrates of first and second larval stage on group O erythrocytes was analyzed by incubating the erythrocyte packed together with an equal volume of larvae (treated RBC) and PBS (control RBC). Distribution and parameters of aggregation (digital image analysis), aggregation kinetics (erythroaggregameter), and viscoelasticity (erythrodeformeter) were measured. The digital image analysis showed that all the larvae diminished the isolated cells percentage and increased the size of the formed aggregates. The aggregate formation velocity was lower in the treated than in the control. The deformability index (ID) values of treated RBC did not present variations with respect to those of the control, but a decrease in the erythrocyte elastic modulus (μm) and membrane surface viscosity (ηm) values was observed, indicating that the larvae not only induced a diminution in the membrane surface viscosity of RBC but also altered the dynamic viscoelasticity of the membrane. Experiments carried out in vitro support the conclusion that the contact between larvae and RBC produces hemorheological alterations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Motivated by the growing evidence of the importance of charge fluctuations in the pseudogap phase in high-temperature cuprate superconductors, we apply a large-N expansion formulated in a path integral representation of the two-dimensional t-J model on a square lattice. We study all possible charge instabilities of the paramagnetic state in leading order of the 1/N expansion. While the d-wave charge density wave (flux phase) becomes the leading instability for various choices of model parameters, we find that a d-wave Pomeranchuk (electronic nematic phase) instability occurs as a next leading one. In particular, the nematic state has a strong tendency to become inhomogeneous. In the presence of a large second nearest-neighbor hopping integral, the flux phase is suppressed and the electronic nematic instability becomes leading in a high doping region. Besides these two major instabilities, bond-order phases occur as weaker instabilities close to half-filling. Phase separation is also detected in a finite temperature region near half-filling. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract={We report here the first measurement of absolute single ionization cross-section of uracil (C4H4N2O2, m=112) in collisions with highly charged C ions of energy ranging between 100 keV to 60 MeV i.e. in the range of Bragg peak which is relevant for high energy hadron therapy. An ECR based low energy accelerator along with a 14 MV Pelletron accelerator were used to obtain a wide range of energies. Energy and charge state (representing perturbation strength) dependence of io-nization cross-section has been studied using a ToF mass spectrometer. In the low energy range, cross-section increases with energy and then saturates while in the high energy range it decreases with energy. Ionization cross-section found to increase linearly with charge-state. The CTMC and CDW-EIS models are used to compare with the data. The complementary experiment was also carried out to measure the low energy electron emission spectrum at different angles. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={We present a theoretical study of single ionization of water molecules in liquid phase by impact of fast electron in a coplanar geometry. Multiple differential cross sections are computed through a first order model in a framework of an independent electron approximation. For the first time in this kind of study, the wavefunctions for a single water molecule in liquid phase are computed in a realistic way through a Wannier orbital formalism. A comparison with previous theoretical and experimental results, the latter corresponding to the gas phase, shows a good agreement. The main physical features of the reaction (such as binary and recoil peaks) are also observed in our results. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Context. The spiral structure of the Milky Way inside the solar circle is still poorly known because of the high density of the material that causes strong extinction towards the Galactic center. Aims. We present results of the first extensive and deep color-color diagram (CCD) photometric survey carried out in the field of the open cluster Trumpler 27, an object immersed in a region of extremely high visual absorption in the constellation of Sagittarius not far from the Galaxy center. The survey covers almost a quarter of square degree. Methods. We look for young stars clumps that might plausibly be associated with spiral structure. Wide-field UBVI photometry combined with infrared information allows us to reconstruct the distribution in the reddening and distance of young stars in the field using the CCD and color-magnitude diagrams (CMD). Results. The analysis of our data, combined with extensive spectroscopy taken from the literature, shows that the real entity of Trumpler 27 as an open cluster is far from being firmly stated. In fact, instead of finding a relatively compact group of stars confined to a small distance range, we found that stars associated with Trumpler 27 are, indeed, a superposition of early-type stars seen along the line of sight extending over several kiloparsecs beyond even the center of the Galaxy. We demonstrate that at each distance range it becomes possible to generate a CMD resembling that of an open cluster. This way, our analysis indicates that what was considered an open cluster characterized by a significant age spread is a stellar continuum that reaches its maximum number of stars at approximately 3.5 kpc from the Sun, the distance of the Scutum-Crux arm approximately. After analyzing the way early-type stars distribute with distance, we found that some of these stellar groups may be linked, within the distance errors, with other inner spiral arms of our Galaxy, including the Near 3 kpc arm at approximately 5 kpc from the Sun. However, very young stars by themselves do not seem to trace strongly the inner spiral arms since they are distributed evenly across several kiloparsecs toward the center of the Galaxy. This is remarkably different to current HI and CO radio observation maps, which show inner spiral arms composed by discrete structures of gas with a well-defined inter-arm separation. © 2012 ESO.},

abstract={We study the low temperature properties of the triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet with a mean field Schwinger spin- 1/2 boson scheme that reproduces quantitatively the zero temperature energy spectrum derived previously using series expansions. By analyzing the spin-spin and the boson density-density dynamical structure factors, we identify the unphysical spin excitations that come from the relaxation of the local constraint on bosons. This allows us to reconstruct a free energy based on the physical excitations only, whose predictions for entropy and uniform susceptibility seem to be reliable within the temperature range 0 ≤T ≲ 0.3J , which is difficult to access by other methods. The high values of entropy, also found in high temperature expansion studies, can be attributed to the roton-like narrowed dispersion at finite temperatures. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

The search covers from -90° to +15° in declination using four different energy ranges above 1 EeV (1018 eV). The method used in this search is more sensitive to neutrons than to photons. The upper limit on a neutron flux is derived for a dense grid of directions for each of the four energy ranges.

abstract={A thorough search for large-scale anisotropies in the distribution of arrival directions of cosmic rays detected above 1018eV at the Pierre Auger Observatory is presented. This search is performed as a function of both declination and right ascension in several energy ranges above 10 18eV, and reported in terms of dipolar and quadrupolar coefficients. Within the systematic uncertainties, no significant deviation from isotropy is revealed. Assuming that any cosmic-ray anisotropy is dominated by dipole and quadrupole moments in this energy range, upper limits on their amplitudes are derived. These upper limits allow us to test the origin of cosmic rays above 1018eV from stationary Galactic sources densely distributed in the Galactic disk and predominantly emitting light particles in all directions. © 2012.

abstract={The Union of South American Nations (Unasur) can be considered as a new emergent region in the world. By using advanced bibliometric methods, the development of science and technology in Unasur is explored. Based on data from the InCites tool of Thomson Reuters, which facilitates national comparisons across long time periods using publication output and normalized citation impact values, we explored how this region (particularly the most productive individual countries within it) is developing. The publication output results reveal an increase in the scientific and technological activities in most of the Unasur countries (especially Brazil). Compared to the rest of the world, the citation impact trend is less favourable for all Unasur countries.},

abstract={At room temperature, conventionally formed Fe-15Mn-5Si-9Cr-5Ni alloys are normally austenitic and the application of a stress induces a reversible martensitic transformation, causing a shape memory effect (SME). However, when the material is processed by a melt-spinning technique, the rapid solidification can stabilize the high-temperature ferritic phase. We found various austenite/ferrite structures in our melt-spun ribbons. The goals of this work were to correlate the process conditions with the resulting phases, find the appropriate heat treatment in order to recover the equilibrium austenitic phase, characterize the different ribbons formed from this material and evaluate the ribbons' shape memory behaviour. We found that annealing at 1050 °C for 60. min, under a protective argon atmosphere, followed by water quenching, fully retains the austenite to room temperature. We compared particular ribbons, those originally austenitic, to the heat treated ones and analyzed the relationship between yield stress and microstructure and texture. The results from the shape memory tests demonstrate that the ribbons are capable of recovering enough of their shape for certain applications. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Any technologically important chemical reaction typically involves a number of different elementary reaction steps consisting of bond-breaking and bond-making processes. Usually, one assumes that such complex chemical reactions occur in a step-wise fashion where one single bond is made or broken at a time. Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory we show that the barriers of rate-limiting steps for technologically relevant surface reactions are significantly reduced if concerted reaction mechanisms are taken into account. Concerted reaction mechanisms on surfaces can have significantly lower barriers than the single steps of which the concerted reaction mechanism consists. This is shown by periodic density functional theory calculations for two technologically important reactions, methanol synthesis on copper (see picture) and hydrogen subsurface penetration on palladium.

abstract={The dislocations and grain boundary mobility in elastic range of loading has been analysed by means of mechanical spectroscopy and neutron diffraction studies in Fe-25at.%Al-8at.%Cr and Fe-25at.%Al-25at.%Cr alloys, in relation to the order degree of the structure. If the alloys are in the ordered state (D0 3 or B2), the mobility of dislocations and grain boundaries is markedly reduced promoting small values of damping. In contrast, when the ordering is suppressed by annealing at temperatures above 973 K, the mobility of dislocations and grain boundaries increases. This leads to an increase in overall damping. In particular, thermally activated damping peaks related to the solute grain boundary peaks due to presence of the aluminium and chromium atoms appear within the temperature interval from 900 to 1100 K, depending on the substitutional atomic content. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The aim of this work is to characterize surface aerosols at the Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory located at Pampa Amarilla, near Malargüe city, in the Andes region of Argentina, with experimental sampling techniques used for the first time in a cosmic ray observatory, adding to information provided by the existing Auger aerosol monitors. A good knowledge of the optical attenuation due to aerosols is crucial for a good reconstruction of the signals from cosmic ray showers detected by the fluorescence detectors of the Observatory. Aerosols were collected in filters, during the Southern Hemisphere winter and spring in 2008. Concentrations in PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 filters were determined by gravimetric analysis and their elemental composition by the PIXE technique, complemented with SEM/EDX. Low aerosol concentrations were measured during the sampling period. The mean total mass PM10 (=PM2.5 + PM2.5-10 fractions) value was [mean(se)] 9.8(1.0) μg/m 3 [sd = 5.9 μg/m 3]. The mean PM10 value during winter was 7(1.1) μg/m 3 [sd = 4.5 μg/m 3], about half of the 13.1(1.5) [sd = 5.7 μg/m 3] measured during springtime. The PM2.5 fraction was approximately 30% of the PM10 fraction. PIXE results gave levels of S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe in the analyzed aerosol samples, showing that these elements correspond to 25% and 13% of the PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 total mass respectively. The rest of the mass was due to the elements with low Z (below 16) which cannot be detected by our X-ray setup. Comparison with SEM/EDX analysis showed that most of them were Si and Al (aluminosilicates). Our results indicate that most of the aerosols at the Auger Observatory would most likely come from the soil of the region. Due to its vast atmospheric monitoring network, the Auger Observatory is an interesting reference site for further atmospheric studies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The Pierre Auger Observatory is exploring the potential of the radio detection technique to study extensive air showers induced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays. The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) addresses both technological and scientific aspects of the radio technique. A first phase of AERA has been operating since September 2010 with detector stations observing radio signals at frequencies between 30 and 80 MHz. In this paper we present comparative studies to identify and optimize the antenna design for the final configuration of AERA consisting of 160 individual radio detector stations. The transient nature of the air shower signal requires a detailed description of the antenna sensor. As the ultra-wideband reception of pulses is not widely discussed in antenna literature, we review the relevant antenna characteristics and enhance theoretical considerations towards the impulse response of antennas including polarization effects and multiple signal reflections. On the basis of the vector effective length we study the transient response characteristics of three candidate antennas in the time domain. Observing the variation of the continuous galactic background intensity we rank the antennas with respect to the noise level added to the galactic signal. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.},

abstract={The Faddeev-Jackiw canonical quantization formalism for constrained systems with Grassmann dynamical variables within the framework of the field theory is reviewed. First, by means of a iterative process, the symplectic supermatrix is constructed and their associated constraints are found. Next, by taking into account the phase space of the system, the constraint structure is considered. It is found that, if there are no auxiliary dynamical field variables, the supermatrix whose elements are the BoseFermi brackets between the constraints associated with the independent dynamical field variables coincides with the symplectic supermatrix corresponding to these independent variables. An alternative procedure to obtain the first-class constraints is given. It is shown that for systems with gauge symmetries, by means of suitable gauge-fixing conditions, a nonsingular final symplectic supermatrix can be found. Then, two possible ways of calculating the Faddeev-Jackiw brackets are pointed out. The relation between the Faddeev-Jackiw and Dirac brackets is discussed. Throughout the previous developments, the Faddeev-Jackiw and Dirac algorithms are compared. Finally, the Faddeev-Jackiw canonical quantization method is applied to a simple model and the obtained results are compared with the ones corresponding to the use of the Dirac procedure on this model. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={The influence of Li impurities on the phase transition sequence of KNbO 3 is investigated using an atomistic model with parameters fitted to first-principles calculations. We find that the replacement of K by Li ions increases local electric dipoles due to a large Li off-centering along [001] directions. Li doping strongly affects the transition temperatures of KNbO 3 as a result of the coupling between the off-center Li relaxation dynamics and the macroscopic polarization of the host material. This coupling produces a decrease in the temperatures for the rhombohedral-orthorhombic and orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transitions, while the temperature of the cubic-tetragonal ferroelectric phase transition increases. The Li relaxation mechanism in the different phases of KNbO 3 provides a simple framework to understand the transition temperature shifts. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Background: Alpha emission from a nucleus is a fundamental decay process in which the alpha particle formed inside the nucleus tunnels out through the potential barrier. Purpose: We describe alpha decay of 212Po and 104Te by means of the configuration interaction approach. Method: To compute the preformation factor and penetrability, we use the complex-energy shell model with a separable T=1 interaction. The single-particle space is expanded in a Woods-Saxon basis that consists of bound and unbound resonant states. Special attention is paid to the treatment of the norm kernel appearing in the definition of the formation amplitude that guarantees the normalization of the channel function. Results: Without explicitly considering the alpha-cluster component in the wave function of the parent nucleus, we reproduce the experimental alpha-decay width of 212Po and predict an upper limit of T 1/2=5.5×10 -7 sec for the half-life of 104Te. Conclusions: The complex-energy shell model in a large valence configuration space is capable of providing a microscopic description of the alpha decay of heavy nuclei having two valence protons and two valence neutrons outside the doubly magic core. The inclusion of proton-neutron interaction between the valence nucleons is likely to shorten the predicted half-live of 104Te. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract={A temperature-induced commensurate solid-solid phase transition in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkylthiolates lying on Pt(111) is predicted from molecular dynamics simulations based on ab initio potential energy surfaces. As the system cools down from room temperature to low enough temperature, SAMs of alkylthiolates with more than ∼12 carbon atoms undergo an abrupt change of orientation from a nearly upright to a tilted configuration. As the initial hexagonal arrangement of the sulfur headgroups is kept fixed during the simulations, the phase transition is entirely governed by chain-chain interactions. Similar commensurate phase transitions are predicted for hexagonally arranged SAMs with lattice spacings of the order of 4.7-4.9 Å, which, among others, excludes the well-known cases of densely packed SAMs of alkylthiolates on Au(111) and Ag(111). These findings could be relevant for the design of novel electronic or optical devices controllable by temperature. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

We found that a sequence of topological transformations takes place as the aspect ratio of the nanostructure changes from elongated nanorods to flat nanoplatelets. Of a particular interest is the formation of a four-vortex state with cores aligned along a closed path. In this way, the vortex structure forms a ring-shaped torus, and a ferroelectric bubble is developed at the center of the ring. The thermal properties of the bubbles indicate that this state is suitable for the development of nanometric ferroelectric devices. Our results cover, for the first time, the gap between the nanodots and wires and between the nanodots and thin films, that is between 0D and 1D as well as between 0D and 2D objects.

We found that LDA not only underestimates the equilibrium volume of the system but also predicts an incorrect ground state for this oxide. The GGA-WC functional, on the other hand, significantly improves the equilibrium volume and provides a relative phase stability in better agreement with experiments.

abstract={The surface detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory can detect neutrinos with energy E ν between 1017 eV and 10 20 eV from point-like sources across the sky south of +55° and north of -65° declinations. A search has been performed for highly inclined extensive air showers produced by the interaction of neutrinos of all flavors in the atmosphere (downward-going neutrinos), and by the decay of tau leptons originating from tau neutrino interactions in Earth's crust (Earth-skimming neutrinos). No candidate neutrinos have been found in data up to 2010 May 31. This corresponds to an equivalent exposure of ∼3.5years of a full surface detector array for the Earth-skimming channel and ∼2 years for the downward-going channel. An improved upper limit on the diffuse flux of tau neutrinos has been derived. Upper limits on the neutrino flux from point-like sources have been derived as a function of the source declination. Assuming a differential neutrino flux k PS E -2 ν from a point-like source, 90% confidence level upper limits for k PS at the level of ≈5 × 10-7 and 2.5 × 10-6 GeV cm-2 s-1 have been obtained over a broad range of declinations from the searches for Earth-skimming and downward-going neutrinos, respectively. © 2012 The American Astronomical Society.

abstract={A higher-derivative classical nonrelativistic U(1)×U(1) gauge field model that describes the electromagnetic interaction of composite particles in 2+1 dimensions is proposed. The model contains a Chern-Simons U(1) field and the electromagnetic U(1) field, and it uses either a composite boson system or a composite fermion one. The second case is explicitly considered. The model is obtained by adding suitable higher-derivative terms to the Lagrangian of a model previously proposed. One of them for the electromagnetic field and the other for the Chern-Simons field. By following the usual Hamiltonian method for singular higher-derivative systems, the canonical quantization is carried out. By extending the Faddeev-Senjanovic formalism, the path integral quantization is developed. Consequently, the Feynman rules are established and the diagrammatic structure is discussed. In this context, only a mixed bosonic propagator can be defined. The use of the higher-derivative terms eliminates the ultraviolet divergence of the primitively divergent Feynman diagrams where the bosonic propagator is present. The unitarity problem, related to the possible appearance of states with negative norm, is treated. A generalization of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin algorithm is applied to the model. We will focus our attention on the issue from the point of view of the field theory. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Damage evolution during low- and high-cycle fatigue in an embrittled duplex stainless steel is characterized in this paper. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy observations (SEM) in combination with electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) measurements and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed in order to analyze microcracks formation and propagation. During low-cycle fatigue, microcracks initiate the ferrite phase either along slip planes with the highest Schmid factor (SF) inside the grains or at the α/α grain boundary. Then, microcracks propagation take place in ferrite or austenite grains with the highest SF. An analysis of the dislocation structure in the near-surface and in ferritic grains in the bulk of the specimen has shown that dislocation microbands are associated with microcrack initiation. In the high-cycle fatigue regime, damage generally initiates in the austenite by slip band formation followed by crack initiation either at an α-α boundary or at an α-γ boundary in the intersection of slip bands in the austenite. The microstructure in the austenite consists of a low density of dislocation pile-ups while the ferrite is practically inactive or develops only micro-yielding at boundaries. Despite the differences in both fatigue regimes, phase boundaries are an effective barrier against crack propagation because they delay the advance of the crack tip. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this work we predict the maximum amplitude, its time of occurrence, and the total length of Solar Cycle 24 by linear regression to the curvature (second derivative) at the preceding minimum of a smoothed version of the sunspots time series. We characterise the predictive power of the proposed methodology in a causal manner by an incremental incorporation of past solar cycles to the available data base. In regressing maximum cycle intensity to curvature at the leading minimum, we obtain a correlation coefficient R≈0. 91 and for the upcoming Cycle 24 a forecast of 78 (90 % confidence interval: 56 - 106). The ascent time also appears to be highly correlated to the second derivative at the starting minimum (R≈-0. 77), predicting maximum solar activity for October 2013 (90 % confidence interval: January 2013 to September 2014). Solar Cycle 24 should come to an end by February 2020 (90 % confidence interval: January 2019 to July 2021), although in this case correlational evidence is weaker (R≈-0. 56). © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In both stainless steels an initial cyclic hardening followed by cyclic softening characterizes the fatigue behavior. The lower stress levels and the more rapid dislocation structure evolution observed in LDX 2101 in comparison with AL 2003 is explained by a solid solution hardening mechanism due to molybdenum in AL 2003. Short cracks initiate along extrusions in ferrite grains and austenite presents an effectiveness barrier to crack propagation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Thermal fluctuations of single layer hydrogenated graphene (graphane) are investigated using large scale atomistic simulations. By analyzing the mean square value of the height fluctuations h2 and the height-height correlation function H(q) for different system sizes and temperatures, we show that hydrogenated graphene is an unrippled system in contrast to graphene. The height fluctuations are bounded, which is confirmed by a H(q) tending to a constant in the long wavelength limit instead of showing the characteristic scaling law q4 -η(η 0.85) predicted by membrane theory. This unexpected behavior persists up to temperatures of at least 900 K and is a consequence of the fact that in graphane the thermal energy can be accommodated by in-plane bending modes, i.e., modes involving C-C-C bond angles in the buckled carbon layer, instead of leading to significant out-of-plane fluctuations that occur in graphene. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Caseins are the precursors of bioactive peptides, which can be released through enzymatic hydrolysis and subsequently be incorporated into food products. This investigation evaluated the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, as well as the physicochemical features, of ovine sodium caseinate (NaCAS) subjected to proteolysis. A Bacillus sp. P45 protease preparation was utilized in the hydrolysis of ovine NaCAS, for up to 7 h. Absorbance and intrinsic fluorescence spectra suggested that the hydrolysis of NaCAS exposed aromatic amino acids to the aqueous media. Following a slight decrease in the surface hydrophobicity (S0) observed up to 2 h of hydrolysis, S 0 increased in the hydrolysates from 3 to 7 h, indicating exposure of hydrophobic groups on the surface of the generated peptides. An increase in the antioxidant properties, evaluated by the 2,2'-azino-bis-(3- ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid method, was observed following hydrolysis up to 4 h. One-hour hydrolysates inhibited the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium fimi, and Listeria monocytogenes, showing antifungal activity of the hydrolysates.

abstract={Low-cycle fatigue tests were performed in three different ferrite/martensite steels, i.e., the European RAFM steel EUROFER 97 and the commercials AISI 410 and AISI 420, at room temperature (RT) and at 550°C. After the first few cycles, a cyclic softening that continues up to failure is observed for all these steels. The cyclic softening exhibited by AISI 420 is less pronounced than for the other two steels. The comparison between the mechanical responses of the materials was based on the study of the flow stress components, i.e., the friction and the back stresses, and their correlation with the microstructure evolution. In most cases, the strong cyclic softening observed is produced by the decreasing stress values exhibited by both stress components. However, at RT, for AISI 420, the back stress does not present variation during cycling. The decrease of the free dislocation density inside the subgrains and the growth of the mean subgrain size represent the main microstructural evolution. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={We used the N-body code of Hernquist &amp; Ostriker to build a dozen cuspy (γ≃ 1) triaxial models of stellar systems through dissipationless collapses of initially spherical distributions of 10 6 particles. We chose four sets of initial conditions that resulted in models morphologically resembling E2, E3, E4 and E5 galaxies, respectively. Within each set, three different seed numbers were selected for the random number generator used to create the initial conditions, so that the three models of each set are statistically equivalent. We checked the stability of our models using the values of their central densities and of their moments of inertia, which turned out to be very constant indeed. The changes of those values were all less than 3 per cent over one Hubble time and, moreover, we show that the most likely cause of those changes are relaxation effects in the numerical code. We computed the six Lyapunov exponents of nearly 5000 orbits in each model in order to recognize regular, partially and fully chaotic orbits. All the models turned out to be highly chaotic, with less than 25per cent of their orbits being regular. We conclude that it is quite possible to obtain cuspy triaxial stellar models that contain large fractions of chaotic orbits and are highly stable. The difficulty in building such models with the method of Schwarzschild should be attributed to the method itself and not to physical causes. © 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2012 RAS.},

abstract={In this work, the influence of plastic anisotropy on forming-limit strains for a drawing-quality steel sheet was investigated. For this purpose, hourglass-type samples, taken at 0°, 45° and 90° with respect to the sheet rolling direction were tested with a typical punch and die fixturing. Numerical simulations were carried out in order to validate two viscoplastic (VP) polycrystalline models, self-consistent (SC) and full-constraint Taylor-type (FC), in conjunction with the Marciniak and Kuczynski (MK) localization approach. The observed shift to the right in the minimum of the forming limit diagram (FLD), inherent to Nakazima test, was taken into account in the simulations. Keeping the set of adjustable parameters to a minimum in the calibration of the viscoplastic polycrystal model, only the material's initial texture and a power law fit to the tensile data needed to be measured. Without other adjustments to either model, MK-VPSC gives realistic predictions over the entire FLD, while the MK-FC predictions only follow the measured limit curve on the tensile side of plane strain. In the positive biaxial quadrant of the FLD, MK-FC predicts unrealistic high limit values. It was found that, despite these extremely high limit values, the similarity in the measured limit strains for the three sample orientations is captured by both models. However, a consistency in the MK-VPSC predictions indicates that this model seems to be a more suitable tool for describing the role of crystallographic texture on the sheet metal forming processes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={In morphological studies the shape may be conveniently quantified by relative dimensions or dimensionless quantities. The analyses of shell morphology and morphospace occupation have been historically approachedmainly bymeans of statistical analysis on classical dimensions (distance measurements: diameter, umbilical width, whorl width, whorl height and apertural whorl height), the Raup's coiling and expansion rate parameters and, more recently, by means of the ADA-model which conjugates the classical variables in a single simple equation. Relationships between these studies should be possible based on mathematical equivalences between classical dimensions and those of coiling and expansion rates. These equivalences, which are presented in this paper, have been obtained on the basis of the ADA-model and a new general method for deriving dimensionless models of morphology based on exponential trajectories as a function of a rotational angle.},

abstract={The generalized Hilbert transforms of potential fields, particularly magnetic fields, provide a useful resource for improving interpretation. Even though x- and y-Hilbert transforms of a potential field on a plane can be approximately computed from the whole observed field, they are locally independent of the observations when working on reduced areas of the plane, and therefore, on those areas, Hilbert transforms can be combined with them to better constrain and stabilize local inversions. Extended Euler deconvolution, based on Euler's homogeneity equation, makes extensive use of this principle. We investigated closed-form expressions for evaluating in the space domain the generalized x- and y-Hilbert transforms of magnetic fields generated by single point sources, given in the form of dipoles, monopoles, and Newtonian potential type sources. Apart from providing a way to calculate Hilbert transforms via equivalent sources, this approach, adding little computer effort, can be applied to solve local inverse problems as a way to improve the definition of a model previous to an inversion over a large area; the solution is modeled by point sources, and it enables matching not only the observations, but also the Hilbert transforms, thus providing stronger constraints. A synthetic example with noisy data demonstrated the resolving power of this approach in locally inverting for magnetization intensities of prismatic bodies using data windows either above or displaced from the sources. In an example from a magnetic anomaly over Sierra de San Luis, Argentina, the magnetization intensities of the basement are locally inverted for at each solution point of an extended Euler deconvolution. Results indicated a more coherent pattern when the Hilbert transforms were incorporated to the inversion, illustrating how local inversions with Hilbert transforms, which do not involve time-consuming operations, can accompany extended Euler deconvolutions to better outline characteristics of a model. © 2012 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract={Among the numerous constituents of eukaryotic cells, the DNA macromolecule is considered as the most important critical target for radiation-induced damages. However, up to now ion-induced collisions on DNA components remain scarcely approached and theoretical support is still lacking for describing the main ionizing processes. In this context, we here report a theoretical description of the proton-induced ionization of the DNA and RNA bases as well as the sugarphosphate backbone. Two different quantum-mechanical models are proposed: the first one based on a continuum distorted waveeikonal initial state treatment and the second perturbative one developed within the first Born approximation with correct boundary conditions (CB1). Besides, the molecular structure information of the biological targets studied here was determined by ab initio calculations with the Gaussian 09 software at the restricted HartreeFock level of theory with geometry optimization. Doubly, singly differential and total ionization cross sections also provided by the two models were compared for a large range of incident and ejection energies and a very good agreement was observed for all the configurations investigated. Finally, in comparison with the rare experiment, we have noted a large underestimation of the total ionization cross sections of uracil impacted by 80 keV protons, whereas a very good agreement was shown with the recently reported ionization cross sections for protons on adenine, at both the differential and the total scale. © 2012 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

abstract={Observations of cosmic ray arrival directions made with the Pierre Auger Observatory have previously provided evidence of anisotropy at the 99% CL using the correlation of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with objects drawn from the Véron-Cetty Véron catalog. In this paper we report on the use of three catalog independent methods to search for anisotropy. The 2pt-L, 2pt+ and 3pt methods, each giving a different measure of self-clustering in arrival directions, were tested on mock cosmic ray data sets to study the impacts of sample size and magnetic smearing on their results, accounting for both angular and energy resolutions. If the sources of UHECRs follow the same large scale structure as ordinary galaxies in the local Universe and if UHECRs are deflected no more than a few degrees, a study of mock maps suggests that these three methods can efficiently respond to the resulting anisotropy with a P-value = 1.0% or smaller with data sets as few as 100 events. Using data taken from January 1, 2004 to July 31, 2010 we examined the 20,30,110 highest energy events with a corresponding minimum energy threshold of about 49.3 EeV. The minimum P-values found were 13.5% using the 2pt-L method, 1.0% using the 2pt+ method and 1.1% using the 3pt method for the highest 100 energy events. In view of the multiple (correlated) scans performed on the data set, these catalog-independent methods do not yield strong evidence of anisotropy in the highest energy cosmic rays. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.},

The existence or non-existence of type Kurdjumov-Sachs crystallographic orientation relations between phases is analysed. The activated slip systems in numerous α and γ grains and the slip transmission conditions between phases are identified. The Schmid factor influence is shown to be different in the austenite and in the ferrite.

abstract={Fast highly charged C and O ion-induced total ionization of an RNA base molecule, uracil (C 4H 4N 2O 2, m=112 amu), has been investigated in a wide energy range of keV to MeV. A combined study of the collision products using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer and an electron spectrometer allows one to determine absolute total ionization cross sections (TCSs). Experimental measurements of TCSs are compared to theoretical predictions performed in the classical trajectory Monte Carlo and classical over-barrier (CTMC-COB) and quantum mechanical (Continuum Distorted Wave with Eikonal Initial State and first-order Born with correct boundary condition) frameworks. The overall energy dependence of the TCSs is approximately reproduced by the models, especially well in the high energy range. The CTMC-COB model provides an excellent agreement for the high-energy data. The projectile charge-state q dependence of TCSs deviates from the well-known quadratic behavior in ion-atom collisions. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Intense fires were produced on the Paraná river delta islands, Argentina, during most part of 2008, by a combination of an exceptionally dry period and the farmers' use of a fire land-cleaning technique. In April 2008, those fires significantly affected the nearby regions and their inhabitants, from Rosario city to Buenos Aires mega-city. In this work we present satellite as well as ground Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 550 nm data obtained during the propagation of pollution clouds to the central zone of Argentina. The highest value (1.18) was registered at Buenos Aires by atmospheric remote sensing, using the satellite instrument MODIS/Terra on April 18th 2008 at 10:35 local time (= UT - 3 h). On the same day, ground air quality detectors also measured in this city the highest Total Suspended Particle (TSP) value of the month, 2.02 mg/m 3. The AOD(550) daily variation at Rosario Astronomical Observatory, which is located near the Paraná riverside, was derived by combining solar ultraviolet erythemal irradiance data (measured with a YES biometre) with model calculations. On April 25th 2008, from 12:00 to 15:30 local time, a rather high and constant AOD(550) value was registered, with a mean value of (0.90 ± 0.21). Cities located on the side of the Rosario-Buenos Aires highway (San Nicolás, Baradero and San Pedro) were also affected, showing a mean AOD(550) between the Rosario and Buenos Aires values. The particulate matter was collected with gridded samplers placed on the Paraná river islands as well as at the Rosario Observatory. They were analysed with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and mainly showed a biological origin. Even if normally large particles travel small distances from the source, organic aerosol in the range of 40-100 μm and complex asymmetric structures were registered several kilometres away from the aerosol sources on the islands. Another event of intense UV index attenuation (98.6%) occurred on September 18th 2008, due to very dense smoke clouds that extended over the Rosario area for several hours. The clouds were driven away from the fires by East-northeast and East-southeast winds. The minimum value of this index measured around noon allows to derive a maximum AOD(550) max = (3.65 ± 0.90) at 12:45 local time. Soot clouds extended over the Paraná river, transporting Burned Biomass Debris (BBD) that deposited on Rosario. In particular, burned leaves and small branches with dimensions of 1-20 cm were collected. The mean (BBD) particles deposited on the ground from 7:00 to 19:00 local time were (0.92 ± 0.20) BBD/(m 2 h). The main purpose of the present work is to contribute to the understanding and quantification of the impact of very dense smoke clouds and BBD that directly and indirectly affected a densely populated area. All the events originated in a very particular and fragile region such as a river delta (with its specific native plants) were registered by using a multi-instrument approach (satellite as well as ground based devices). The analysis of these events, as detailed in this manuscript, was used as a scientific reference for the judicial claim made at the Supreme Court of Justice of Argentina by the National University of Rosario, against the authorities of the Entre Rios Province where the islands of the Paraná river are placed, in order to take the necessary measures for the suspension of the biomass burning in these islands. © 2011 COSPAR.

Nearly fully recoverable strains up to the order of 6%, associated with cubic to monoclinic martensitic transformation β 1→ β 1', have been measured by thermal cycling under constant load experiments. Such a degree of strain recovery is typical of single crystals or polycrystalline arrays with a low degree of grain constraint, such as highly textured, " bamboo" like, extruded materials. The reversible transformation strains reached about 68% of the upper bound predicted by a Sachs-type model which averages the most favorable martensite variants in each grain, taking into account their orientation and disregarding interactions between them. Due to the strong texture introduced in the material, such high values of recoverable transformation strains are obtained even for specimens having a grain size/thickness ratio of ∼0.05, producing relatively high grain constraint. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The dissociation of H 2 on Ti-covered Al surfaces is relevant to the rehydrogenation and dehydrogenation of the NaAlH 4 hydrogen storage material. The energetically most stable structure for a 1/2 monolayer of Ti deposited on the Al(100) surface has the Ti atoms in the second layer with a c(2 × 2) structure, as has been confirmed by both low-energy electron diffraction and low-energy ion scattering experiments and density functional theory studies. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of H 2 dissociation on a slab model of this Ti/Al(100) surface. Two six-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) have been built for this H 2 + Ti/Al(100) system, based on the density functional theory PW91 and RPBE exchange-correlation functionals. In the PW91 (RPBE) PES, the lowest H 2 dissociation barrier is found to be 0.65 (0.84) eV, with the minimum energy path occurring for H 2 dissociating above the bridge to top sites. Using both PESs, H 2 dissociation probabilities are calculated using the classical trajectory (CT), the quasi-classical trajectory (QCT), and the time-dependent wave-packet methods. We find that the QCT H 2 dissociation probabilities are in good agreement with the quantum dynamics results in the collision energy range studied up to 1.0 eV. We have also performed molecular beam simulations and present predictions for molecular beam experiments. Our molecular beam simulations show that H 2 dissociation on the 1/2 ML Ti/Al(100) surface is an activated process, and the reaction probability is found to be 6.9% for the PW91 functional and 1.8% for the RPBE at a nozzle temperature of 1700 K. Finally, we have also calculated H 2 dissociation rate constants by applying transition state theory and the QCT method, which could be relevant to modeling Ti-catalyzed rehydrogenation and dehydrogenation of NaAlH 4. © 2012 The Owner Societies.},

abstract={A phase evaluation method was recently proposed to measure nanometric displacements by means of digital speckle pattern interferometry when the phase change introduced by the deformation is in the range [0,π)rad. To evaluate the phase change, however, it is necessary to record separately the intensities of the object and the reference beams corresponding to both the initial and the deformed interferograms. This paper presents a fast approach that overcomes this limitation. The rms phase errors introduced by the proposed method are determined using computer-simulated speckle interferograms and its performance is also compared with the results obtained with a phase-shifting technique. An application of the proposed phase retrieval method to process experimental data is finally illustrated. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The crossed lamellar microstructure of mollusk shells shows a very complex hierarchical architecture constituted of long rod-shaped aragonite crystals stacked parallel to each other inside each first order lamella, which are almost perpendicular to the ones contained in parallel neighboring lamellae. To better understand the construction and properties of the crossed lamellar microstructure we have performed a detailed study to determine the crystallographic characteristics and their evolution during shell growth using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction texture analysis. The arrangement of crystals is rationalized by a set of twin law relationships between aragonite crystals. Specifically, the aragonite rods, or third order lamellae within each first order lamella, internally consist of polysynthetic twins bounded by {1 1 0} mirror planes. In turn, the polysynthetically twinned aragonite crystals also show a constant crystallographic orientation with respect to aragonite crystals in adjacent first order lamellae. It can be seen as another twin law in which crystals from adjacent lamellae are bounded by (1 1 0) planes but with their c-axes rotated within this plane by 30°. Thus there are two sets of twin laws that relate crystal units at lower (third order lamellae) and higher (first order lamellae) length scales. These hierarchical relationships play a crucial role in the construction, organization and properties of this complex microstructure. The later orientational relationships have never been described in geological aragonite and are only found in biogenic materials with a crossed lamellar microstructure. Their occurrence is probably determined by the presence of shell organic components which regulate crystal growth and may favor unusual crystallographic relationships. © 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract={The hole-doped ground state of a recently introduced extended "t-U-J" two-orbital Hubbard model for the Fe-based superconductors is studied via exact diagonalization methods on small clusters. Similarly as in the previously studied case of electron doping, upon hole doping it is observed that there are several competing pairing symmetries, including A 1g, B 1g, and B 2g. However, contrary to the electron-doped case, the ground state of the hole-doped state has pseudocrystal momentum k=(π,π) in the unfolded Brillouin zone. In the two Fe-atom per unit cell representation, this indicates that the ground state involves antibonding, rather than bonding, combinations of the orbitals of the two Fe atoms in the unit cell. The lowest state with k=(0,0) has only a slightly higher energy. These results indicate that this simple two-orbital model may be useful to capture some subtle aspects of the hole-doped pnictides, since calculations for the five-orbital model have unveiled a hole pocket centered at M [k=(π,π)] in the unfolded Brillouin zone. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract={We investigate the dynamics of a single hole coupled to the spiral fluctuations related to the magnetic ground states of the antiferromagnetic J 1-J 2-J 3 Heisenberg model on a square lattice. Using exact diagonalization on finite size clusters and the self-consistent Born approximation in the thermodynamic limit, we find, as a general feature, a strong reduction of the quasiparticle weight along the spiral phases of the magnetic phase diagram. For an important region of the Brillouin zone the hole spectral functions are completely incoherent, whereas at low energies the spectral weight is redistributed on several irregular peaks. We find a characteristic value of the spiral pitch Q=(0.7,0.7)π, for which the available phase space for hole scattering is maximum. We argue that this behavior is due to the nontrivial interference of the magnon-assisted and the free-hopping mechanism for hole motion, characteristic of a hole coupled to semiclassical spiral fluctuations. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract={We present the results of an analysis of data recorded at the Pierre Auger Observatory in which we search for groups of directionally-aligned events (or 'multiplets') which exhibit a correlation between arrival direction and the inverse of the energy. These signatures are expected from sets of events coming from the same source after having been deflected by intervening coherent magnetic fields. The observation of several events from the same source would open the possibility to accurately reconstruct the position of the source and also measure the integral of the component of the magnetic field orthogonal to the trajectory of the cosmic rays. We describe the largest multiplets found and compute the probability that they appeared by chance from an isotropic distribution. We find no statistically significant evidence for the presence of multiplets arising from magnetic deflections in the present data. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Duplex coatings on stainless steel American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) 310 were prepared by a double process consisting of a plasma nitriding treatment and a multilayer ZrO2-3 mol % Y2O3 coating grown by chemical solution deposition. In this paper we investigate the interdiffusion phenomena between the elements and the deposited phases. The zirconia coating process over the nitrided steel initiated strong diffusion events. Hydrogen diffuses easily throughout the coating and acts as a reducing agent. The layer of zirconia works as a sieve, retaining nitrogen and allowing the passage of hydrogen. The contribution of this study show the interdiffusion at the interfaces of elements in samples subjected to treatments known as duplex coatings. Copyright © 2011 by ASTM International.},

abstract={The excellent combination of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of duplex stainless steel is obtained from balanced amount of ferrite and austenite in the microstructure. However, this grade of steel embrittles when exposed in the temperature range of 280-500°C limiting its application to temperatures below 280°C. To study the effect of embrittlemnt on fatigue behavior at high strain ranges, plastic-strain-controlled LCF test and at low strain ranges, stress-controlled HCF/VHCF tests were conducted on 1.4462 duplex steel and accompanied by SEM analysis in combination with EBSD. Extensive TEM was done to study the micromechanism of fatigue crack initiation and propagation across the strain ranges.},

abstract={The Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory is sensitive to neutrinos of all flavors above 0.1 EeV. These interact through charged and neutral currents in the atmosphere giving rise to extensive air showers. When interacting deeply in the atmosphere at nearly horizontal incidence, neutrinos can be distinguished from regular hadronic cosmic rays by the broad time structure of their shower signals in the water-Cherenkov detectors. In this paper we present for the first time an analysis based on down-going neutrinos. We describe the search procedure, the possible sources of background, the method to compute the exposure and the associated systematic uncertainties. No candidate neutrinos have been found in data collected from 1 January 2004 to 31 May 2010. Assuming an E -2 differential energy spectrum the limit on the single-flavor neutrino is E2dN/dE&lt;1.74×10 -7GeVcm -2s -1sr -1 at 90% C.L. in the energy range 1×1017eV&lt;E&lt;1×1020eV. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract={In this paper we introduce the concept of Lateral Trigger Probability (LTP) function, i.e., the probability for an Extensive Air Shower (EAS) to trigger an individual detector of a ground based array as a function of distance to the shower axis, taking into account energy, mass and direction of the primary cosmic ray. We apply this concept to the surface array of the Pierre Auger Observatory consisting of a 1.5 km spaced grid of about 1600 water Cherenkov stations. Using Monte Carlo simulations of ultra-high energy showers the LTP functions are derived for energies in the range between 1017 and 1019 eV and zenith angles up to 65°. A parametrization combining a step function with an exponential is found to reproduce them very well in the considered range of energies and zenith angles. The LTP functions can also be obtained from data using events simultaneously observed by the fluorescence and the surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory (hybrid events). We validate the Monte Carlo results showing how LTP functions from data are in good agreement with simulations. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The information regarding solar UV radiation (UVA + UVB) in Brazil and around the world is scarce with low spatial and temporal coverage. This information scarcity, due to the small number of measuring stations, has directed some researchers towards the creation of computational parametric models or the generation of statistical models for the estimation of the UV radiation from the measurement of the global radiation. Information about UV irradiation is expanded for other places where there is only global radiation data. Thus, two stations were set up, in 2008, one in the city of Pesqueira and the other in Araripina, both in the state of Pernambuco, for simultaneous measurements of daily global solar and UV radiation. Another station is being set up in Recife-PE, completing a group of stations that are located between latitudes 8 and 10° and longitudes 34-38° W, representing the typical climate of the region. The daily values of G global and UV ultraviolet radiation (A + B) striking the horizontal plane in Pesqueira and Araripina during the time period (2008-2010) were measured, analyzed and compared. The collected data enabled the generation of three different statistical models for estimating the daily UV solar radiation from the daily global radiation: a) linear correlation between global and UV radiation (model 1), b) polynomial correction of the average fraction of UV irradiation, 〈F UV〉 as a function of the transmittance index of global solar irradiation 〈K T〉 (model 2) and c) the UV atmospheric transmittance index 〈K TUV〉 is obtained by multiple regression of the air mass 〈m r〉and 〈K T〉 (model 3). Besides, they were modeled by two artificial neural networks: a) estimative of the (F UV), considering the same physical variables of model 2 (model ANN1) and b) estimative of (K TUV) from the same physical variables of model 3 (model ANN2). The statistical models and the artificial neural networks displayed a good statistical performance with RMSE% inferior to 5% and MBE between -0.4%-2%. All the models can be used for estimating the UV radiation in places where there is only global irradiation data. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We have performed molecular dynamics simulations using a shell model potential developed by fitting first-principles results to describe the behavior of the relaxorferroelectric (1x)PbMg 1/3Nb 2/3O 3xPbTiO 3 (PMNxPT) as a function of concentration and temperature, using site occupancies within the random site model. In our simulations, PMN is cubic at all temperatures and behaves as a polar glass. As a small amount of Ti is added, a weak polar state develops, but structural disorder dominates, and the symmetry is rhombohedral. As more Ti is added the ground state is clearly polar and the system is ferroelectric, but with easy rotation of the polarization direction. In the high Ti content region, the solid solution adopts ferroelectric behavior similar to PT, with tetragonal symmetry. The ground state sequence with increasing Ti content is RM BOM CT. The high-temperature phase is cubic at all compositions. Our simulations give the slopes of the morphotropic phase boundaries, crucial for high-temperature applications. We find that the phase diagram of PMNxPT can be understood within the random site model. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={We present a comprehensive study of the influence of the geomagnetic field on the energy estimation of extensive air showers with a zenith angle smaller than 60°, detected at the Pierre Auger Observatory. The geomagnetic field induces an azimuthal modulation of the estimated energy of cosmic rays up to the ∼ 2% level at large zenith angles. We present a method to account for this modulation of the reconstructed energy. We analyse the effect of the modulation on large scale anisotropy searches in the arrival direction distributions of cosmic rays. At a given energy, the geomagnetic effect is shown to induce a pseudo-dipolar pattern at the percent level in the declination distribution that needs to be accounted for. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},

abstract={Motivated by the recent discovery of Fe-based superconductors close to an antiferromagnetic insulator in the experimental phase diagram, here the five-orbital Hubbard model (without lattice distortions) is studied using the real-space Hartree-Fock approximation, employing a 10×10 Fe cluster with Fe vacancies in a √5×√5 pattern. Varying the Hubbard and Hund couplings, and at electronic density n=6.0, the phase diagram contains an insulating state with the same spin pattern as observed experimentally, involving 2×2 ferromagnetic plaquettes coupled with one another antiferromagnetically. The presence of local ferromagnetic tendencies is in qualitative agreement with Lanczos results for the three-orbital model also reported here. The magnetic moment ∼3μB/Fe is in good agreement with experiments. Several other phases are also stabilized in the phase diagram, in agreement with recent calculations using phenomenological models. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract={We report total-energy calculations for different crystal structures of NaNbO3 over a range of unit-cell volumes using the all-electron full-potential (linearized) augmented plane-wave method. We employed both the local-density approximation (LDA) and the Wu-Cohen form of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA-WC) to test the accuracy of these functionals for the description of the complex structural behavior of NaNbO3. We found that LDA not only underestimates the equilibrium volume of the system but also predicts an incorrect ground state for this oxide. The GGA-WC functional, on the other hand, significantly improves the equilibrium volume and provides relative phase stability in better agreement with experiments. We then use the GGA-WC functional for the calculation of the phonon-dispersion curves of cubic NaNbO3 to identify the presence of structural instabilities in the whole Brillouin zone. Finally, we report comparative calculations of structural instabilities as a function of volume in NaNbO3 and KNbO3 to provide insights for the understanding of the structural behavior of K 1-xNaxNbO3 solid solutions. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

This method integrates a special device of indentation to a universal measuring machine. The mentioned device allows introducing elongated indents allowing to diminish the absolute error of measurement. It must be noted that the present method offers the great advantage of avoiding both the specific equipment and highly qualified personnel, and their inherent high costs. In this work, the cutting tool geometry and high speed parameters are selected to introduce reduced plastic damage. Through the variation of the depth of cut, the stability of the shapes adopted by the residual strain and stress distributions is evaluated. The results show that the strain and stress distributions remain unchanged, compressive and small. Moreover, these distributions reveal a similar asymmetry when the gradients corresponding to conventional and climb cutting zones are compared.},

It is shown that under definite conditions and for particular orientations of the molecule, the main physical features of the ionization reaction, which are the binary and recoil peaks usually associated with classical mechanisms, are completely erased by quantum interference effects that resemble the ones predicted previously for photoionization reactions. However, these new effects cannot be derived from photoionization results, as the electromagnetic field cannot transfer momentum. In addition, it is found that the emission spectra of transitions leading to the final gerade and ungerade states of the H2+ residual target are analogous in certain cases to the patterns of two sources emitting waves in phase or antiphase, respectively. Finally, we show how an average of the emission from randomly oriented molecules produces a binary peak at the classical expected position, in agreement with experiments. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

The procedure was tested in the negative glow of a pulsed Ar-N2 discharge at a pressure of 2.5 Torr, for different mixture concentrations. In this discharge, through the fitting, it was possible to calculate the variation of the N2(C) densities produced by different excitation processes as well as the variation of Ar metastable density. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={To understand the role that degeneracy, hybridization, and nesting play in the magnetic and pairing properties of multiorbital Hubbard models we here study numerically two types of two-orbital models, both with holelike and electron-like Fermi surfaces (FS's) that are related by nesting vectors (π,0) and (0,π). In one case the bands that determine the FS's arise from strongly hybridized degenerate dxz and dyz orbitals, while in the other the two bands are determined by nondegenerate and nonhybridized s-like orbitals. Using a variety of techniques, in the weak-coupling regime it is shown that only the model with hybridized bands develops metallic magnetic order, while the other model exhibits an ordered excitonic orbital-transverse spin state that is insulating and does not have a local magnetization. However, both models display similar insulating magnetic stripe ordering in the strong-coupling limit. These results indicate that nesting is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the development of ordered states with finite local magnetization in multiorbital Hubbard systems; the additional ingredient appears to be that the nested portions of the bands need to have the same orbital flavor. This condition can be achieved via strong hybridization of the orbitals in weak coupling or via the FS reconstruction induced by the Coulomb interactions in the strong-coupling regime. This effect also affects the pairing symmetry as demonstrated by the study of the dominant pairing channels for the two models. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

We study the energetics and relative stability of different polarized clusters embedded in a PE matrix of ADP. We find that local ferroelectric and AFE clusters are stable and may coexist in the PE phase, which explains the coexistence of both type of microregions determined by electron spin probe measurements above the AFE-PE transition temperature. The dependency with the O-H⋯O bridge length of the energy barrier heights for proton transfer is studied for coordinated proton displacements along the bridges within clusters of different sizes. This dependency may have implications for the geometric isotopic effects on Tc. We analyze Mulliken orbital and bond populations which confirm the existence of a charge flow within the N-H 4 + ion, an essential fact for the stabilization of the AFE phase over other possible polarized structures. This charge transfer is correlated with the optimization of the N-H⋯O bridges and with distortions of the NH4 + group. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={Sodium caseinate (NaCAS) is a very useful ingredient in food industry because of its nutritional and functional properties. Acidification produces a gel structure as a result of the dissociation and aggregation of caseinic fractions. Formation of these protein gels can be made by the slow reduction of pH through the addition of glucono-delta-lactone (GDL). Depending on its concentration and temperature, hydrolysis speed of GDL can affect the grade of hardness and elasticity of the formed gel. This study evaluated the effect on the formation and structure of protein gels induced by different relations of GDL through analysis of digital images obtained in an inverted conventional microscope and a confocal microscope. The entropy, smoothness and variance decrease with the added GDL quantity, but the uniformity increases. Results confirm that the texture depends on gelification speed, which is directly related to the amount of added GDL. This digital image analysis technique using conventional or confocal microscopy is, therefore, suitable and very useful for the texture analysis of acid gels formed by different GDL/NaCAS rates.},

The parameters of isobaric analog resonance (IAR) are calculated in the framework of the Lane-model (Nucl. Phys. A 35:676, 1962) using CXSM. The novel feature of the present CXSM calculation is that the optical potentials used are complex. Results of the CXSM calculation are checked against those of the standard solution of the coupled channel Lane-equations (CC). The IAR parameters calculated by the CXSM agree well with that of the CC results for absorptive and emittive optical potentials. This agreement confirms the applicability of the CXSM calculation for complex potential. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={We describe a new mechanism leading to the formation of rational magnetization plateau phases, which is mainly due to the anharmonic spin-phonon coupling. This anharmonicity produces plateaux in the magnetization curve at unexpected values of the magnetization without explicit magnetic frustration in the Hamiltonian and without an explicit breaking of the translational symmetry. These plateau phases are accompanied by magneto-elastic deformations, which are not present in the harmonic case. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract={The pseudogap phase of high-Tc cuprates is controversially attributed to preformed pairs or to a phase which coexists and competes with superconductivity. One of the challenges is to develop theoretical and experimental studies in order to distinguish between both proposals. Very recently, researchers at Stanford have reported angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments on Pb-Bi2201 supporting the point of view that the pseudogap is distinct from superconductivity and associated to a spacial symmetry breaking without long-range order. In this paper, we show that many features reported by these experiments can be described in the framework of the t-J model considering self-energy effects in the proximity to a d charge-density-wave instability. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract={We study the dimensional crossover from two dimensional to one dimensional (1D) in the structure of the graphene honeycomb lattice when one of the dimensions of the layer is reduced by analyzing the thermally excited rippling. Through a joint study, by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using a quasiharmonic potential and by analytical calculations, we find that the normal-normal correlation function does not change its power law behavior in the long wavelength limit. However, the dependency of the square of the out-of-plane displacement (h2) against the system size changes its scaling behavior when going from a layer to a nanoribbon. We show that a new scaling law appears which corresponds to a truly 1D behavior and we estimate the ratio of the sample dimensions where the crossover takes place as R2D1D1.609. Having explored a wide number of realistic system sizes, we conclude that narrow ribbons present stronger corrugations than the square graphene layers and we discuss the implications for the electronic properties of free-standing graphene samples. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

If the particles responsible for these excesses at E &gt; Eth are heavy nuclei with charge Z, the proton component of the sources shouldłead to excesses in the same regions at energies E/Z. We here report thełack of anisotropies in these directions at energies above Eth/Z (for illustrative values of Z = 6,13,26). If the anisotropies above Eth are due to nuclei with charge Z, and under reasonable assumptions about the acceleration process, these observations imply stringent constraints on the allowed proton fraction at thełower energies. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},

Moreover, this is related to the fact that for this molecular orientation and under certain conditions, the electron cannot be emitted in the direction of the radiation field. On the contrary, for H 2 molecules perpendicular to the polarization direction, the angular distribution of electrons is analogous to the one observed in the two slits Young's experiment.},

The wavefunctions for a single water molecule in the liquid phase are obtained through a Wannier orbital formalism and the ejected electron is described by means of Coulomb functions. We also present averaged calculations over all molecular orientations. A comparison with previous theoretical and experimental results, the latter corresponding to water in gaz phase, shows a good agreement. The main physical features of the reaction (such as binary and recoil peaks) present in measurements for vapor are also observed in the present theoretical predictions.},

abstract={We compute the dynamical structure factor of the spin- triangular Heisenberg model using the mean-field Schwinger boson theory. We find that a reconstructed dispersion, resulting from a non-trivial redistribution of the spectral weight, agrees quite well with the spin excitation spectrum recently found with series expansions. In particular, we recover the strong renormalization with respect to linear spin wave theory along with the appearance of roton-like minima. Furthermore, near the roton-like minima the contribution of the two spinon continuum to the static structure factor is about 40% of the total weight. By computing the density-density dynamical structure factor, we identify an unphysical weak signal of the spin excitation spectrum with the relaxation of the local constraint of the Schwinger bosons at the mean-field level. Based on the accurate description obtained for the static and dynamic ground-state properties, we argue that the bosonic spinon theory should be considered seriously as a valid alternative to interpret the physics of the triangular Heisenberg model. © 2011 Europhysics Letters Association.},

abstract={In the present work we aim to characterize the lattice configurations and the magnetic behavior in the incommensurate phase of spin-Peierls systems. This phase emerges when the magnetic exchange interaction is coupled to the distortions of an underlying triangular lattice and has its experimental realization in the quasi-one-dimensional compound family TiOX (X=Cl, Br). With a simple model of spin-1/2 chains inserted in a planar triangular geometry which couples them elastically, we are able to obtain the uniform-incommensurate and incommensurate-dimerized phase transitions seen in these compounds. Moreover, we follow the evolution of the wave vector of the distortions with temperature inside the incommensurate phase. Finally, we predict gapless spin excitations for the intermediate phase of TiOX compounds along with incommensurate spin-spin correlations, offering to experimentalists a candidate to observe an exotic Luttinger liquidlike behavior. © 2011 American Physical society.},

abstract={In this research, we analyze forming-limit strains of FCC and BCC materials using a viscoplastic self-consistent polycrystal model (VPSC) in conjunction with the Marciniak-Kuczynski (MK) approach. In particular, our work is focused on the theoretical analysis and comparison between FCC and BCC crystal structures made by Inal et al. [Inal, K., Neale, K.W., Aboutajeddine, A., 2005. Forming limit comparison for FCC and BCC sheets, International Journal of Plasticity, 21, 1255-1266]. These authors performed their simulations based on a generalized Taylor-type polycrystal model (MK-FC), finding a remarkably low forming-limit curve for the FCC material and an extremely high forming-limit curve for the BCC material, in the biaxial stretching range. We verified that our predictions are similar to Inals results for both FCC and BCC materials when the MK-FC model is used. However, MK-VPSC calculations do not give such extreme values, and we believe that this theory predicts much more reliable results for both FCC and BCC crystallographic assumptions. We also found that localized necking depends on texture evolution in the vicinity of equi-biaxial stretching, through the sharpness of the predicted yield surface. Finally, it is shown that the MK-VPSCs predictions are in good agreement with experimental data for AA5182-O and a DQ-type steel-sheet metal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We report from first-principles-based atomistic simulations that ferroelectricity can be sustained in PbTiO3 nanoparticles of only a few lattice constants in size as a result of a toroidal ordering. We find that size-induced topological transformations lead to the stabilization of a ferroelectric bubble by the alignment of vortex cores along a closed path. These transformations, which are driven by the aspect ratio of the nanostructure, change the topology of the polarization field, producing a rich variety of polar configurations. For sufficiently flat nanostructures, a multibubble state bridges the gap between 0D nanodots and 2D ultrathin films. The thermal properties of the ferroelectric bubbles indicate that this state is suitable for the development of nanometric devices. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract={The cyclic behaviour of the steel EUROFER 97 during isothermal plastic straincontrolled tests was investigated at room temperature and at 550°C. Under these test conditions, the steel shows, after the first few cycles, a cyclic softening following a power-law function that continues up to failure. The rate of softening increases with temperature, being very pronounced at temperatures above 50°C. The evolution of the flow stress during cycling was studied by analyzing the so-called "back" and "friction" stresses obtained from the hysteresis loops measured along the entire test. From the analysis of the hysteresis loops and corroborated by electron microscopy observations, it can be concluded that the strong cyclic softening observed on these samples with a "tempered martensite" structure is produced by the softening exhibited by both stresses. However, the importance of each of these stresses on the softening depends on the applied strain amplitude and temperature. It was observed that, at low temperatures and applied strains, the friction stress shows the strongest influence on the cyclic softening. On the contrary, at higher temperatures and applied strains the back stress reveals the most important changes occurring in the interior of the material. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

A strongly site dependent reactivity is observed in line with results obtained for the density of states projected onto the W and Cu atoms of the topmost layer. H2 dissociation on a defect free terrace of W(100)-c(2 × 2)Cu is found to be a non-activated process like on W(100), despite the reduction of the number of energetically accessible dissociation pathways at low impact energies due to the presence of Cu atoms. A prominence of dynamic trapping and a reduction of the efficacy of trapping to promote dissociation is also verified, leading to a decrease of the initial sticking probability as a function of the molecular impact energy, in qualitative agreement with experimental findings. The heterogeneous reactivity is also evidenced by two different kinds of reflection events at low energies. Its combination gives rise to a broad specular peak superimposed on a cosine-like angular distribution of scattered molecules which is in good agreement with available experimental data. © 2011 the Societies Owner.},

abstract={The effect of the type of the solvent alcohol and its molar proportion on the drying critical thickness of 3 mol% Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) sol-gel films was examined experimentally and modeled analytically. To this end, zirconium n-propoxide was dissolved using different solvent alcohols (ethanol, methanol, and propanol) and different molar proportions of propanol (alcohol-to-alkoxide molar ratios of ~6.5, 11.5, or 16.5), and the resulting sol-gel solutions were dip-deposited at different substrate withdrawal rates until cracking occurred after drying at 100 °C. It was found that the drying critical thickness, i.e., the maximum thickness that can be reached without film cracking, was greatest when the solvent alcohol was propanol, despite the tensile strength of the gelled network being the lowest. The use of ethanol and methanol as solvent alcohols results in sol-gel films with greater strength but thinner drying critical thicknesses. The analysis of the results using a drying stress model showed the drying critical thickness to be conditioned by the balance between the evaporation rate and viscosity of the sol-gel solutions, and the experimental data indicated that the predominant factor to take into account when choosing the solvent alcohol is the evaporation rate of the solution. It was also found that the critical thickness increases with increasing molar proportion of solvent alcohol, again despite the decreasing tensile strength of the gelled network. The analytical modeling of the drying stresses indicated that, once the solvent alcohol has been chosen, the determining factor in the drying critical thickness is the viscosity of the sol-gel solutions. Implications for obtaining thicker, crack-free, sol-gel films of YSZ or other oxide ceramics during drying that have greater tensile strength are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Dimerized quantum spin systems may appear under several circumstances, e.g. by a modulation of the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling in space, or in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets. In general, such systems display a quantum phase transition to a Néel state as a function of a suitable coupling constant. We present here two path-integral formulations appropriate for spin S=1/2 dimerized systems. The first one deals with a description of the dimers degrees of freedom in an SO(4) manifold, while the second one provides a path-integral for the bond-operators introduced by Sachdev and Bhatt. The path-integral quantization is performed using the Faddeev-Jackiw symplectic formalism for constrained systems, such that the measures and constraints that result from the algebra of the operators is provided in both cases. As an example we consider a spin-Peierls chain, and show how to arrive at the corresponding field-theory, starting with both an SO(4) formulation and bond-operators. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The mi-crostructure and ferroelectricity of SBTW films as functions of dopant concentration and annealing temperature were studied. Well-defined hysteresis loops were obtained for the doped films annealed between 650°C and 750°C. The ferroelectric properties, however, were not improved compared to those of undoped SBT films due to the appearance of a non-ferroelectric secondary phase. © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

These properties are expected to be relevant to the PE-FE phase transition. The obtained SM results are compared to corresponding ab initio (AI) data. The global instabilities are found in good agreement for both KDP and DKDP. We also find qualitative good agreement in the KDP structure and even quantitative agreement in the expanded DKDP structure for the local distortions. The SM results reproduce well different trends like increasing instabilities as the cluster sizes grows, as the heavier atoms are included, and as the volume is increased, in accordance with the corresponding data from AI calculations. © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

It was found that the crystallization occurs at temperatures close to 300 °C. A gradual increase in the grain and crystallite sizes is observed as the sintering temperature increases up to 1000 °C, and above this sintering temperature the tendency changes abruptly with a rapid increase in these values. Although Young's modulus of the coatings did not change with sintering temperature, a slight decrease was observed in the hardness values above 1000 °C which is attributed to microstructure coarsening. Finally, a slight degradation of the films occurs above 1300 °C, which is due to the occurrence of a process of grain spheroidization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

The experimental data are analyzed in terms of a state-of-the-art theoretical model based on a two-effective-center approximation. In the case of the H2 molecule the binary peak in the double-differential cross sections (DDCS) is enhanced due to the two-center Young-type interference. The observed undulation in the DDCS ratio is explained in terms of the combined contributions of the Compton profile mismatch and the interference effect. The influence of the interference effect is thus observed for higher-energy electrons compared to most of the earlier studies which focused on low-energy electrons produced in soft collisions. © 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Tilt Scanning Interferometry (TSI) has been recently developed as an experimental method to measure multi-component displacement fields inside the volume of semitransparent scattering materials. It can be considered as an extension of speckle interferometry in 3D, in which the illumination angle is tilted to provide depth information, or as an optical diffraction tomography technique with phase detection. It relies on phase measurements to extract the displacement information, as in the usual 2D counterparts. A numerical model to simulate the speckle fields recorded in TSI has been recently developed to enable the study on how the phase and amplitude are affected by factors such as refraction, absorption, scattering, dispersion, stress-optic coupling and spatial variations of the refractive index, all of which may lead to spurious displacements. In order to extract depth-resolved structure and phase information from TSI data, the approach had been to use Fourier Transformation of the intensity modulation signal along the illumination angle axis. However, it turns out that a more complete description of the imaging properties of the system for tomographic optical diffraction can be achieved using a 3D representation of the transfer function in k-space. According to this formalism, TSI is presented as a linear filtering operation. In this paper we describe the transfer function of TSI in 3D k-space, evaluate the 3D point spread function and present simulated results. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

Theoretical predictions in terms of differential and total cross sections for proton, α-particle and bare ion carbon beams impacting on adenine, cytosine, thymine and guanine bases are then reported in the 10 keV amu -1-10 MeV amu-1 energy range. The calculations are performed within the first-order Born approximation (FBA) with biological targets described at the restricted Hartree-Fock level with geometry optimization. Comparisons to recent theoretical data for collisions between protons and cytosine point out huge discrepancies in terms of differential as well as total cross sections whereas very good agreement is shown with our previous classical predictions, especially at high impact energies (E i ≤ 100 keV amu-1). Finally, in comparison to the rare existing experimental data a systematic underestimation is observed in particular for adenine and thymine whereas a good agreement is reported for cytosine. Thus, further improvements appear as necessary, in particular by using higher order theories like the continuum-distorted-wave one in order to obtain a better understanding of the underlying physics involved in such ion-DNA reactions. © 2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

abstract={A higher-derivative classical nonrelativistic U(1) × U(1) gauge field model that describes the topologically massive electromagnetic interaction of composite particles in 2+1 dimensions is proposed. This is made by adding a suitable higher-derivative term for the electromagnetic field to the Lagrangian of a model previously proposed. The model contains a Chern-Simons U(1) field and the topologically massive electromagnetic U(1) field, and it uses either a composite boson system or a composite fermion one. The second case is explicitly considered. By following the usual Hamiltonian method for singular higher-derivative systems, the canonical quantization is carried out. By extending the Faddeev-Senjanovic formalism, the path integral quantization is developed. Consequently, the Feynman rules are established and the diagrammatic structure is discussed. The use of the higher-derivative term eliminates in the Landau gauge the ultraviolet divergence of the primitively divergent Feynman diagrams where the electromagnetic field propagator is present. The unitarity problem, related to the possible appearance of states with negative norm, is treated. A generalization of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin algorithm is applied to the model. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

The study is based on a recently developed formalism for nonadiabatic spin-Peierls systems based on bosonization and a mean field RPA approximation for the interchain coupling. To reproduce the measured low temperature spin gap, a spin-phonon coupling quite bigger than the one predicted from an adiabatic approach is required. This high value is compatible with the renormalization of the phonons in the high temperature phase seen in inelastic x-ray experiments. Our theory accounts for the temperature of the incommensurate transition and the value of the incommensurate wave vector at the transition point. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Its dimensions are 100 km long, about 50 km wide, plus an average altitude of 500 m above sea level. The basin is situated among the mountain ranges of De la Huerta, Guayaguas and Las Quijadas to the west, and the ranges of Chepes, Ulapes and San Luis to the east, with a NW-SE orientation. Its surface is approximately 5,700 km 2 with an average depth of 5 km increasing in a northerly direction. The southern part of the basin is separated from the Beazley basin by the buried San Pedro ridge. New gravimetric information and archive file data, density data (from wells) and seismic reinterpretation allowed us to obtain an integrated model, which involved: a) seismic basement situated at a depth of 3.5 km obtained from seismic reinterpretation; b) crystalline basement with an average depth of 5 km obtained from inverted gravimetric data; c) perimeter and internal faults system reaching 11 km in depth suggesting a listric type disposition in depth, thick-skinned type, obtained from 2-D seismic reinterpretation, spectral analysis technique and alignments obtained from Euler's technique; d) succession of density data extracted from wells allowing us to perform a gravimetric inversion from Bouguer's anomalies operating with variable density; e) a system of three asymmetric breached anticlines crossed by three systems of inverse faults and f) regional structure serving as evidence, permitting us to dimension the compressive framework to which the region has been subjected. Our purpose is that this well-defined integrated model will contribute to the search for further geological structures of economic interest.},

The degree of correlation between the gravimetric and magnet ometric fields was analyzed using the Poisson relation. In order to do this 1) a vertical gradient map of gravity was compared to the map of magnetic anomalies reduced at the pole, 2) the magnetization-density relation between the two potential fields was analyzed showing a distinct change in polarity. Complementary calculations (the analytic signal in one transverse sector of the NPC) have shown the existence of a central geological fault dividing it into two blocks. Based on the gravimetric model and the polarity changes, the inferred geometry encountered on both sides of the NPC leads to the intuition of mineralogical differences between the composition and origin of the Eastern and Western NPC.},

abstract={he sheet-metal industry uses Lankford coefficients and the forming-limit curve, FLC, as standards for characterizing a sheet's ability to be stretched and deep drawn. Investigators have recently made significant advances in computer codes that predict these measures of formability. However, complete experimental data sets that provide input properties and verification data for the simulations rarely exist for a single material. The current investigation focused on obtaining such data for a single drawing-quality steel sheet. Measurements intended for the calibration and initial verification of the simulation code include uniaxial-tension tests, through-thickness and plane-strain compression experiments, and quantitative texture - orientation distribution function - evaluations, while a comparison between measured and simulated Lankford coefficients, Part I, and an FLC, Part II, provide a rigorous verification of the computer simulations. In order to initially verify the simulations, we performed through-thickness and plane-strain compression measurements. A key experimental result was that the fiow curve in free, through-thickness compression - an experiment that corresponds to biaxial stretching - lies 18% above the uniaxial tensile data. The plane-strain compression curve is another 11% above the free-compression stress/strain data. We measured the Lankford coefficients, as a function of angle to the rolling direction, for the same steel sheet, finding the maximum values in and at 90 to the rolling direction, 1.59 and 1.89 respectively. A minimum Lankford coefficient of 1.19 was measured at 45 to the rolling direction. For calibrating a rate-dependent visco-plastic self-consistent polycrystal model we needed only to measure the material's initial texture and to fit power-law and saturation-hardening laws to our tensile data. This kept the set of adjustable parameters to a minimum. Without other adjustments to the model, we predicted the correct stress levels in the free and channel-die compression experiments as well as values of Lankford coefficients. These successes indicate that the polycrystal model should be capable of simulating the entire FLC, Part II. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In Part I of the current paper, we showed the results of uniaxial-tension tests, through-thickness and plane-strain compression experiments, quantitative texture - orientation distribution function - evaluations and Lankford coefficient measurements. These data were used for calibration and verification of a visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) polycrystal-plasticity simulation code for predicting a steel sheet's ability to be stretched and deep drawn. Lankford coefficients are one, although incomplete, measure of a steel's drawing quality. In order to obtain a deeper insight and better verification of the simulation code, we measured the forming-limit curve, FLC, for the same steel sheet. To make these measurements we stretched circle-gridded sheets of material with a punch and die. Samples had both a flat-sided and hourglass geometry and ranged from 20 to 80 mm in width. The 80 mm wide sample completely filled the die. With this range of sample sizes, we spanned all of the stress states applicable to a FLC, from uniaxial to biaxial tension. Our FLC curve had the classic "V" shape typical of drawing-quality steel, with a minimum safe forming strain of about 0.35 in plane-strain deformation and a safe forming strain of nearly 0.45 in balanced biaxial stretching. To model the FLC behavior, we used the same VPSC model and calibration employed in Part I. In order to obtain a necking instability in the calculation, a Marciniak defect was implemented into the VPSC model. The severity of the defect was adjusted to match the measured instability strain, 0.35, in plane-strain deformation. Both hardening laws fit in Part I were used to calculate the FLC. In the positive biaxial quadrant of the FLC, the limit strains predicted by the power law closely follow the measured uniform deformations, while the saturation law appears to over predict the limit strains. In uniaxial-tension, it was the opposite. The power-law hardening predictions seemed excessive. However, if we consider the FLC curve to be a band of finite width, both hardening laws and the VPSC formulation capture the essence of the FLC data. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this work, we report and discuss the detection of two distant diffuse stellar groups in the third Galactic quadrant. They are composed of young stars, with spectral types ranging from lateOto late B, and lie at galactocentric distances between 15 and 20 kpc. These groups are located in the area of two cataloged open clusters (VdB-Hagen 04 and Ruprecht 30), projected toward the Vela-Puppis constellations, and within the core of the Canis Major overdensity. Their reddening and distances have been estimated by analyzing their color-color and color-magnitude diagrams, derived from deep UBV photometry. The existence of young star aggregates at such extreme distances from the Galactic center challenges the commonly accepted scenario in which the Galactic disk has a sharp cutoff at about 14 kpc from the Galactic center and indicates that it extends to much greater distances (as also supported by the recent detection of CO molecular complexes well beyond this distance). While the groups we find in the area of Ruprecht 30 are compatible with the Orion and Norma-Cygnus spiral arms, respectively, the distant group we identify in the region of VdB-Hagen 04 lies in the external regions of the Norma-Cygnus arm, at a galactocentric distance (∼20 kpc) where no young stars have been detected so far in the optical. © 2010.

abstract={Expanded austenite generation through ion carburizing of AISI 316L using two different reactive gas mixtures (Ar 50%, H2 45%, CH4 5% and Ar 80%, H2 15%, CH4 5%) has been studied. It was found that an ñ14μm surface layer of expanded austenite was developed with 30min processing for both gas mixtures. Nevertheless, AES analyses have shown that on the ñ150nm surface layer carbon in a concentration of ñ12% was diffused and located as carbide. For longer periods of processing, while for the gas mixture with 50% of Ar no significant modifications within those 150nm surface layer were produced, for the gas mixture with 80% of Ar a gradual increase in the carbon concentration with time was found, with the extra carbon remaining as free carbon. The difference between both situations can be attributed to the different resulting current densities that have been of 7.0mAcm-2 and 8.1mAcm-2 for 50% and 80% of Ar respectively. Higher current densities result in higher carbon and Ar ions fluxes inducing, from one side surface element concentration modification through sputtering, and from the other the enhancement of carbon diffusion on the first hundred nanometers of the surface layers. This free carbon on top of the surface layers can act as solid lubricant reducing wear rate. Nevertheless, and in spite of the fact that expanded austenite was proved to be corrosion resistant, a reduction against NaCl solution corrosion in relation to the base material was observed. This lost to corrosion resistance can be attributed to carbide development on the layers closer to the surface that can work as a trigger for localized corrosion. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The derived force field, based on a sum of so-called exp-6 pairwise potentials and effective Coulomb interaction potential between the HS- heads, predicts very well the interaction energies for dimers and trimers of alkanethiols not included in the input database for the fit. Also the calculated minimum energy tilt angle of the alkyl chains for a hexagonal arrangement of alkanethiolates with a nearest neighbor distance of 5 Å is in good agreement with the available experimental data for a √3 × √3 self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on Au(111).

abstract={We have constructed first principle based six-dimensional (6D) potential energy surfaces (PESs) describing the interaction of H2 with Cu(111) obtained by interpolation of a set of density functional theory (DFT) total energy data. The DFT calculations have been performed within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) framework. In applying the GGA we have tested the two exchange-correlation (XC) functionals most popular in surface science, i.e., the PW91 and RPBE functionals. The interpolation of the PW91 PES has been performed using two different methods, the corrugation reducing procedure (CRP), which has been proven to be one of the most successful interpolation methods to build 6D PESs, and the modified Shepard (MS) interpolation method, a very promising method to build high dimensional (nD) PESs, which is computationally cheaper than the CRP. We show that, in spite of the difference between the CRP-PES and the MS-PES and the inaccuracies found in the latter, quantum and classical reaction and scattering probabilities obtained for both PESs are very similar. We also show that PW91 predicts higher reactivity than RPBE, due to the presence of lower energy dissociation barriers in the PW91-PES. The differences between the PW91-PES and the RPBE-PES are also reflected in the vibrational excitation and rotational excitation probabilities, and the diffraction patterns. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={As other metallic materials, in low-cycle fatigue, duplex stainless steels (DSS) exhibit a cyclic hardening, followed by a cyclic softening, before stabilization of the stress. In order to simulate the cyclic hardening/softening curves in low-cycle fatigue of an austenitic-ferritic or duplex stainless steel (DSS), a new polycrystalline model is proposed. The polycrystalline model developed by Cailletaud (1992) and Pilvin (1990) and modified by Hoc and Forest (2001) was previously extended in Evrard et al. (2008) in order to take into account the bi-phased character of the DSS. This model correctly accounts for the cyclic hardening, but it is not able to simulate the cyclic softening, consequently, stresses at the stabilized state are overestimated. TEM observations of the dislocation structures built during a cyclic uniaxial tension/compression test show that, during the cyclic hardening, planar arrangements are observed in austenitic grains and no significant evolution is observed during the subsequent cyclic softening and stabilization stage. On the contrary, in ferritic grains, dislocations are homogeneously distributed during cyclic hardening, and the microstructure evolves during the subsequent cyclic softening and stabilization stage. Dislocation structures build progressively, consisting of hard zones or walls, separated by soft zones or channels. We propose to model the cyclic softening through dislocation structure evolution within ferritic grains. The single crystal law used by Hoc and Forest (2001) is modified in order to take into account the heterogeneous distribution of dislocations in the ferrite. Numerical simulations are compared with experimental data. A good agreement is observed between experimental and calculated hardening/softening curves and stabilized hysteresis loops. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Stainless steels are used predominantly for their corrosion resistance in moderate to highly aggressive environments. For construction purposes, engineers normally select carbon steel due to low cost, long experience, applicable design rules and a large variety of strength classes. However, different stainless steel types can also provide a very wide range of mechanical properties and they have the advantage of not needing surface protection. Duplex Stainless Steels (DSSs) in particular, are austeno-ferritic steels with twice the mechanical strength of conventional austenitic and ferritic stainless steels and have a potential use in construction. In the early 1980's, a 'second generation' of duplex steels was introduced with better weldability mainly through nitrogen alloying. The most common duplex grade today is the UNS S32205/S31803, which is used in a great number of applications in a wide variety of product forms. This grade was the basis for the development of a 'third generation' of duplex steels. These higher alloys are called super-duplex stainless steels and identified as UNS S32750/S32760. The cyclic hardening-softening response, the cyclic stress-strain curve and the microstructure evolution of a high nitrogen duplex stainless steel S32750 have been evaluated and the results compared with reference to low and medium nitrogen duplex stainless steels, S32205 and S32900 grades, respectively. The beneficial effects of nitrogen on the cyclic properties of most modern alloys have been analyzed in terms of the flow stress components, i.e. the back and the friction stress. A phenomenological model is proposed to explain the influence of nitrogen atoms on the cyclic behavior of these steels. © 2010 TIIM, India.},

abstract={We study the effects of the structural corrugation or rippling on the electronic properties of undoped armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs). First, reanalyzing the single corrugated graphene layer we find that the two inequivalent Dirac points (DPs) move away from each other. Futhermore, the Fermi velocity vF decreases when the rippling increases. Regarding the AGNRs, whose metallic behavior depends on their widths, we analyze, in particular, the case of the zero-gap band-structure AGNRs. By solving the Dirac equation with adequate boundary conditions we show that, due to the shifting of the DP, a gap opens up in the spectra. This gap scales with the square of the rate between the height and the wavelength of the deformation. We confirm this prediction by an exact numerical solution of the finite width rippled AGNR. Moreover, we find that the quantum conductance, calculated by the nonequilibrium Green's function technique, vanishes when the gap opens up. The main conclusion of our results is that a conductance gap should appear for all undoped corrugated AGNR, independently of their widths. © 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Ammonites are of outstanding importance in dating events of the Mesozoic and in the study of mechanisms, modes and timing of evolutionary processes. These applications rely on a detailed understanding of their morphology and the modes of variation. It has been known for a long time that their shape is composed of a number of highly correlated features. A new model, called the ADA-model, is introduced for the study of shell morphology (size and shape). The new model is based on classic dimensions which are stable parameters throughout ontogeny, giving very close agreement between predictions and actual observations. It was applied in the exploration of the morphospace occupied by the planispirally coiled and the regularly uncoiled Mesozoic Ammonoidea, based on two new reduced morphospaces introduced for the analysis. Results obtained expose close relationships between size and shape, and general patterns in the ammonite shell morphology and morphogenesis. (i) The relative apertural height of the whorl section relative to the diameter of the shell (H2/D) is involved in definition of size and shape. (ii) This same dimension shows a strong tendency to be H2/D = 0.3. (iii) There are some geometrically possible shell shapes (or morphotypes) which seem to have not been developed since they are not known in the current record. Assuming the known ranges of protoconch size and whorl number as constraints, the ADA-model strongly suggests that these morphotypes have not been developed for the too large or too small sizes the shells would have attained, well outside of the actual size range of the planispirally coiled Ammonoidea. (iv) The law of covariation is shown to be a general pattern within the planispiral ammonites which describes structured variation of the shell shape, (v) A large fraction of the non-structured variation seems originate in the lack of correlation between the relative umbilical diameter and width of the whorl section.},

Under Low-Cycle Fatigue (LCF) test this steel shows, after the first few cycles, a pronounced cylic softening accompanied by microstructural changes such as the decrease of the dislocation density inside the subgrain. During LCF tests, the softening seems to be governed by a mechanism independent of the plastic strain range imposed to the specimen. From the analysis of the peak tensile stress of the hysteresis loops and its respective correlation with the transmission electron microscopy observations can be concluded that the cyclic softening observed at room temperature could be attriuted to the progressive annihilation of dislocactions located in the interior of the subgrains.},

Among the investigated cases, the alloy containing 15% Mn, rolled at 800°C and annealed at 650°C, the recovery temperature, shows the best shape memory behavior.},

abstract={An approach based on reactive force fields is applied to the parametrization of potential energy surface (PES) for chemical reactions on surfaces with a benchmark system, H2 /Pd (111). We show that a simple reactive force field based on the second moment approximation does not allow for obtaining reliable results of reaction dynamics for the considered system. With a more elaborate reactive force field, i.e., reactive bond order (REBO) force field, we succeeded in obtaining a reliable PES for H2 /Pd (111). The accuracy of the constructed REBO force field is carefully checked through various tests including the comparison not only between energies calculated with density functional theory and those with REBO force field but also between the available results of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and those with our force field. Moreover, our REBO force field is endowed with some transferability since the force field constructed with a database containing only information on H2 /Pd (111) allows for obtaining also accurate results for H2 /Pd (100) and qualitatively correct results for H2 /Pd (110) without any refitting. With the help of our reactive force field, the molecular dynamics simulation for the dissociation of H 2 on the considered Pd surfaces is speeded up by five orders of magnitude compared to ab initio molecular dynamics method. The demonstrated reliability and the very high computational efficiency of reactive force fields open extremely attractive perspectives for studying large-scale complex reacting systems. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={We present the results of a surface modification of AISI 316L stainless steel by surface irradiation with high energy, pulsed nitrogen ion beams generated with 0.8 kJ dense plasma focus. The surface characterization was done using GAXRD, Auger electrons spectroscopy, TEM and optical microscopy. After the irradiation, we found a modification of a 1 μm thick surface layer, on which a gradual lattice expansion of the austenite with the number of irradiation pulses, i.e. with the total nitrogen ion fluence, was observed. In addition, ~ 40 nm close to the surface layer, a disordered lattice structure had been observed through TEM analysis. Those results can be explained in terms of the extreme thermal effect induced on the surface through the fast high energy release during the pulsed ion interaction with the steel surface, followed by an also rapid cooling down process which limits the nitrogen diffusion to the bulk. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A new method for experimentally determining the electron density (n e) and the electron temperature (T e) in the negative glow of a nitrogen pulsed discharge is presented. It is based on optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and consists of a variation and refinement of relatively similar schemes previously reported for different working conditions by other authors. The bottom line is the measurement of the emission intensities of the (0,0) bands of the first negative system at 391.44 nm and of the (0,2) bands of the second positive system at 380.49 nm. The suggested procedure allows the establishment of the absolute values of n e and T e, as long as one calibration point is provided, such as the electron density at one specific discharge condition. If this calibration point is unavailable, the method nonetheless yields a qualitative dependence of T e and n e. Langmuir probe measurements confirm and validate the OES results for n e, thereby legitimizing the diagnostic technique developed. The interpretation of the results for T e is slightly more complex, and in some circumstances an accurate determination of T e may require further analysis. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

It is found that because of the proper treatment of the continuum intrinsic to the formalism, giant pairing resonances lie much higher than previously predicted and that some of them may be too wide to be observed, whereas others are meaningful excitations.

abstract={In the Northeast region of Brazil, a relatively large amount of information about solar global radiation is available, however, this is not the case for the ultraviolet component. In this context, two stations were installed from the begining of 2007, one at Pesqueira and the other one at Araripina, both in the Pernambuco State, in order to obtain simultaneous data of solar global irradiation and UV. Another station is been placed at Recife, which will give information in a rather large tropical área, with latitudes between 8° S and 7° S and longitudes between 34° W and 40° W. Based on the Pesqueira and Araripina measurements done in the period 2007 to 2009, a correlation was established between the global and UV daily irradiation values and compared with similar data for other regions of the world. These results are of interest for the determination of the solar UV component, in geographical places were there are no data of this irradiation, but it exist information about the global irradiation.

abstract={Processing steels to achieve particular useful properties is a science as well as an art. Many of the properties of modern steels are a successful combination of empiric and scientific knowledge. Deep drawing low carbon steels have been used and improved through many decades of research and technological advance. However the micro mechanisms involved in the development of particular microstructures and properties are still under discussion. The current paper shows an integrated attempt to obtain consistent microscopic data from micromechanical simulations coupled with recrystallization and phase transformation codes. The simulations are performed in a way such that the information obtained from certain temperatures, levels or processes are used in the next steps to proceed further. The goal is not avoiding experiments but having a whole through scale and time integration for judging the validity of similar parameters and assumptions during the different processing steps. The simulations include high and low temperature deformation and recrystallization in the austenite region, phase transformation to room temperature, low temperature deformation and recrystallization in the ferrite phase region. The results are compared with experiments available in the literature. © by Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, München.},

The understanding of such processes is of both basic and economical importance to decipher deformation regimes, mechanisms and Presure-Temperature (PT) conditions. The Guamanes Deformation Belt (GDB) is a shear zone at Sierras de Córdoba (Argentina) which extends approximately 45 kilometers parallel to the 64°50'00" meridian. Its width varies in between 1 and 4 kilometers and can be subdivided in a northern and southern tracts. The southern part has been already quite well studied with a complete description of its mylonitic rocks and the kinematic. Phyllonites in the northern tract and mylonites with phyllonites and non deformed rocks in the southern tract apparently separate two well defined domains of deformation. Two different deformation events, one ductile followed by a brittle stage, have been identified. We will present ductile textures developed in quartz veins included in strongly deformed granitic pegmatites which were intruded in the shear belt during the deformation. The data will be analyzed by regular texture analysis and viscoplastic self consitent simulations. The kinematic inferred from the simulations indicates a main reverse sense of displacement with a minor sinistral component developed in a simple shear regime. © by Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, München.},

abstract={We have developed an equivalent-source method for performing reduction to the pole and related transforms from magnetic data measured on unevenly spaced stations at different elevations. The equivalent source is composed of points located vertically beneath the measurement stations, and their magnetic properties are chosen in such a way that the reduced-to-the-pole magnetic field generated by them is represented by an inverse-distance Newtonian potential. This function, which attenuates slowly with distance, provides better coverage for discrete data points. The magnetization intensity is determined iteratively until the observed field is fitted within a certain tolerance related to the level of noise; thus, advantages in computer time are gained over the resolution of large systems of equations. In the case of induced magnetization, the iteration converges well for verticalor horizontal inclinations, and results are stable if noise is taken into account properly. However, for a range of intermediate inclinations near 35°, a factor tending to zero makes it necessary to perform the reduction through a two-stage procedure, using an auxiliary magnetization direction, without significantly affecting the speed and stability of the method. The performance of the procedure was tested on a synthetic example based on a field generated on randomly scattered stations by a random set of magnetic dipoles, contaminated with noise, which is reduced to the pole for three different magnetization directions. Results provide a good approximation to the theoretical reduced-to-the-pole field using a one- or a two-stage reduction, showing minor noise artifacts when the direction is nearly horizontal. In a geophysical example with real data, the reduction to the pole was used to correct the estimated magnetization direction that originates an isolated anomaly over Sierra de San Luis, Argentina. © 2009 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

abstract={In this paper we study an acoustic system comprised of two identical closed tubes connected with a short one, and a quantum-mechanical square well with a delta function potential. Both systems can be thought of as mathematically equivalents to the homogeneous string with a concentrated mass at its middle point. We describe also a simple experimental device to measure the resonances of the acoustic system as a function of the connecting tube section. The experimental setup and the theoretical approach we have employed can be used in both undergraduate and graduate level courses. Moreover, this work may be useful as a teaching aid in other experimental research projects such as for instance the study of the emergence of the band structure in solid state physics. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The kinetics of microcrack growth during cycling has been studied in a S32205 duplex stainless steel in the as-received and aged (100 h at 475 °C) conditions. Cylindrical specimens with a shallow notch were subjected to a constant plastic strain range of 0.3% in both thermal conditions. The characteristic features of surface damage and crack growth showed striking differences in microcrack density, nucleation location and propagation rate between the two thermal conditions even though the fatigue lives are comparable. In the as-received material, microcrack density is low and they nucleate mainly at grain and phase boundaries or second-phase particles. In the aged condition, slip markings first appear in the ferritic phase and they are the preferred site for microcrack nucleation. Crack propagation takes place along slip markings in adjacent grains for crack lengths less than 100 μm. A comparison between fatigue life and the relevant parameters of a microcrack growth law was made. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We study the dynamics of HD and H2 molecules interacting with Pd(1 1 1) and Cu(1 1 0) using the classical trajectory method based on potential energy surfaces obtained from Density Functional Theory calculations. Our results predict a negligible isotopic effect on the dissociative adsorption probability on Pd(1 1 1) whereas on Cu(1 1 0), the adsorption probability for HD (νi = 0) is slightly lower than for H2 (νi = 0), mainly due to its lower initial vibrational zero point energy. The final rotational energy distribution of scattered HD and H2 molecules are very similar. This shows that the asymmetric mass distribution of HD, barely affects the fraction of initial translational energy transferred to rotation during the scattering process. Our calculations point to the larger number of open rotational excitation channels for HD, as the main cause of rotational excitation probabilities larger than for H2. The theoretical apparent rotational temperature, Trot, of HD molecules scattered from Pd(1 1 1) at impact energy Ei = 75 meV, is in good agreement with the experimental value. In contrast, for Cu(1 1 0) the theoretical Trot is much lower than the value measured for Cu(1 0 0). Possible reasons for such a discrepancy between theory and experiments are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We used a multipolar code to create, through dissipationless collapses of systems of 106 particles, two cuspy self-consistent triaxial stellar systems with γ ≈ 1. One of the systems has an axial ratio similar to that of an E4 galaxy and it is only mildly triaxial (T = 0.914), while the other one is strongly triaxial (T = 0.593) and its axial ratio lies in between those of Hubble types E5 and E6. Both models rotate although their total angular momenta are zero, i.e., they exhibit figure rotation. The angular velocity is very small for the less triaxial model and, while it is larger for the more triaxial one, it is still comparable to that found by Muzzio (Celest Mech Dynam Astron 96(2):85-97, 2006) to affect only slightly the dynamics of a similar model. Except for minor evolution, probably caused by unavoidable relaxation effects of the N-body code, the systems are highly stable. The potential of each system was subsequently approximated with interpolating formulae yielding smooth potentials, stationary in frames that rotate with the models. The Lyapunov exponents could then be computed for randomly selected samples of the bodies that make up the two systems, allowing the recognition of regular and of partially and fully chaotic orbits. Finally, the regular orbits were Fourier analyzed and classified using their locations on the frequency map. Most of the orbits are chaotic, and by a wide margin: less than 30% of the orbits are regular in our most triaxial model. Regular orbits are dominated by tubes, long axis ones in the less triaxial model and short axis tubes in the more triaxial one. Most of the boxes are resonant (i.e., they are boxlets), as could be expected from cuspy systems. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract={In the present contribution is shown that the free, online available geoid undulations are an efficient indicator of the isostatic condition of significant geologic structures. This is the case of the sedimentary basin known as the La Rioja valley, where a filtered maximum local undulation of -2 meters was found by applying the Eigen 03 model. Searching for a higher definition, the geoid undulations of this basin were calculated with: a) the planar Stokes' method, and b) the equivalent sources method. Both provide a maximum undulation of -1.8 meters, which coincides in approximately 90% with the undulation obtained with the Eigen 03 method. Comparing the values of -1.8 meters obtained from a) and b) with the undulation value found for a perfectly compensated Airy isostatic model, a negative residuum of -60 cm was determined, which clearly indicates the absence of an antiroot. This result agrees with the negative excess shown by the Bouguer anomalies, thus opening an expeditious new way for evaluating the isostatic balance.},

Dobry, arXiv:0810.3018v1] for the incommensurate transition in the spin-Peierls TiOX (X=Cl, Br) compounds, in the present work we start by studying the thermodynamics of the model with XY spins and adiabatic phonons. We find that the system enters an incommensurate phase by a first order transition at a low temperature Tc 1. At a higher temperature Tc 2 a continuous transition to a uniform phase is found. Furthermore, we study the magnetism in the incommensurate phase by density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations on a one-dimensional Heisenberg model where the exchange is modulated by the incommensurate atomic position pattern. When the wave vector q of the modulation is near π, we find local magnetized zones (LMZ) in which spins abandon their singlets as a result of the domain walls induced by the modulated distortion. When q moves far away enough from π, the LMZ disappear and the system develops incommensurate magnetic correlations induced by the structure. We discuss the relevance of this result regarding previous and future experiments in TiOCl. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

From the tetragonal ferroelectric c phase, the transition takes place in a finite range of temperature where the lattice parameter normal to the plane keeps approximately constant until Tc is reached.

abstract={We present an extensive study based on the density functional theory (DFT) of the hydrogen dissociative adsorption on strained pseudomorphic monolayers of Cu or Pd deposited onto a Ru(0001) substrate. First, the full six-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) are obtained by interpolation of the DFT ab initio calculations using the corrugation reducing procedure. The accuracy of these PESs is analyzed in detail. Then, the dissociative adsorption probability has been determined by means of six-dimensional (6D) quasi-classical dynamics simulations for both normal and off-normal incidence. Although H2 dissociation is known to be non activated on Pd(111) and strongly activated on Cu(111), we have found that it is activated on both Pd/Ru(0001) and Cu/Ru(0001). Surprisingly, the minimum activation energy for H2 dissociation is very similar on both pseudomorphic monolayers, ∼100 meV. In both cases, H2 dissociation occurs after the first encounter between the molecule and the surface (direct process) and, as expected, the adsorption probabilities follow, to a good approximation, normal energy scaling. © 2009 the Owner Societies.},

abstract={CuZnAl alloys show pseudoelasticity, shape memory behavior and if adequately treated also the two way shape memory effect (TWSME), i.e., shape change due to the martensitic transition both during cooling and by heating. The origin of this phenomenon has been strongly discussed and the role that diffusion and dislocations play on the introduction of the TWSME has been and still is discussed in the literature. However many of the reported training or educational methods show the overlapping of dislocation generation and diffusion both in the austenite and in the martensite. This work deals with the introduction of the TWSME in CuZnAl single crystals by pseudoelastic cycling at temperatures low enough to disregard the contribution of diffusion, which influences the martensitic bcc-M18R transition at temperatures as low as room temperature in these alloys. The microstructure responsible for the introduction of the TWSME is discussed and the analysis of the effect of dislocation arrays, retained martensite, precipitates and microplasticity is presented. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The association of experimental data showing that the plastic deformation of olivine, the main constituent of the upper mantle, is highly anisotropic and the ubiquitous seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle, which indicates that olivine crystals show coherent orientations over scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers, implies that the long-term deformation in the upper mantle is anisotropic. We propose a multiscale approach, based on a combination of finite element and homogenization techniques, to model the deformation of a lithospheric plate while fully considering the mechanical anisotropy stemming from a strain-induced orientation of olivine crystals in the mantle. This multiscale model explicitly takes into account the evolution of crystal preferred orientations (CPO) of olivine and of the mechanical anisotropy during the deformation. We performed a series of numerical experiments simulating the uniaxial extension of a homogeneous (100% olivine) but anisotropic plate to test the role of the olivine CPO on the plate mechanical behavior and the link between CPO and mechanical anisotropy evolution. Even for this simple solicitation, different orientations and intensity of the initial olivine CPO result in variable plate strengths and deformation regimes. A plate with an initial CPO where the olivine [100] and [010] axes are concentrated at 45° to the extension direction has high resolved shear stresses on the easy (010)[100] and (001)[100] slip systems of olivine. This results in low strength and in deformation by transtension. Plates with an initial CPO where the maximum of [100] axes is parallel or normal to the extension direction show a high initial strength. Isotropic plates have an intermediate behavior. The progressive rotation of olivine [100] axes toward the imposed stretching direction results in hardening in all models, except in those characterized by an initial concentration of olivine [100] axes normal to the imposed extension, in which softening is followed by hardening. © 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract={We study H2 dissociative adsorption on Pd(100) through classical molecular dynamics (MD) calculations, using density functional theory (DFT) to describe the molecule-surface interaction potential. We employ two methods to evaluate the forces acting on the atoms along the trajectories: (i) by doing a DFT calculation (and using the Hellman-Feynman theorem) every time step, and (ii) by computing the gradient of a six-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) obtained first, by interpolation of DFT total energy results using the corrugation reducing procedure (CRP). The corresponding MD calculations, hereafter referred to as ab initio MD (AIMD) and CRP-PES-MD, respectively, provide very similar dissociative adsoption probabilities (Pdiss) as a function of the impact energy (Ei) for initial rotational states characterized by 0 ≤J≤ 4 indicating that the interpolated CRP-PES gives a faithful representation of the underlying ab initio PES. Thus, we make use of the computationally cheaper CRP-PES-MD for a detailed analysis of rotational effects on dissociative adsorption for 0 ≤J≤ 12. In agreement with available experimental data for H2 interacting with Pd surfaces, we have found that Pdiss barely depends on J for Ei≥ 200 meV, and that it follows a non-monotonic J-dependence at low energies. Our simulations show that two competing dynamical effects which were previously suggested based on lower-dimensional model calculations are indeed also operative at low energies in a realistic high-dimensional treatment. For low values of J, a shadowing effect prevails that entails a decrease of P diss when J increases, whereas for J &gt; 6, rotational effects are dominated by the adiabatic energy transfer from rotation to perpendicular motion that provokes the increase of Pdiss with increasing J. © the Owner Societies 2009.},

Using ab initio multireference configuration interaction method, we computed a large ensemble of data, which was used to generate a fit of each potential energy surface for bending angles θ80° degrees and OH distances ROH 1.0 a.u. The fit is used to investigate the dissociation dynamics along each potential energy surface for several initial geometries corresponding to Franck-Condon transition from neutral or singly ionized water molecule. For each case, we determine the dissociation channels and we compute the kinetic energy release and angular momentum distribution of the final arrangements. Among the eight potential energy surfaces investigated here, only the lowest triplet and the three lowest singlet can lead to the formation of bound residual fragment. The dissociation of HOD2+ presents a strong preference for OH rather than OD bond breakage. It is characterized by the isotopic ratio, defined as the number of OD+ over the number of OH+ residual fragments. This ratio depends strongly on the shape of each potential energy surface and on the initial conditions. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

Trajectories are computed for several state-specific conditions: collision energies (0.05-4 eV), surface temperatures (300, 1100 K), incident angles (0-60°), internal (v,j) states of O2, etc. Several possible processes are examined in detail for both reactions. Reflection and non-dissociative sticking are the main channels for O2 scattering; the dissociative channel becomes only open at high collision energies, and it is essentially promoted in the regions close to the Si atoms of the first layer of slab. O sticking is the main process for O scattering; reflection and Eley-Rideal (ER) reaction probabilities have different extension depending on the initial conditions of reactants. Final ER O2 molecules remain principally stuck to the slab.},

abstract={By using the Hubbard $\hat{X}$-operators as field variables along with the supersymmetric version of the FaddeevJackiw symplectic formalism, a family of first-order constrained Lagrangians for the t-J model is found. In order to satisfy the Hubbard $\hat{X}$-operator commutation rules satisfying the graded algebra spl(2,1), the number and kind of constraints that must be included in a classical first-order Lagrangian formalism for this model are presented. The model is also analyzed via path-integral formalism, where the correlation-generating functional and the effective Lagrangian are constructed. In this context, the introduction of a proper ghost field is needed to render the model renormalizable. The perturbative Lagrangian formalism is developed and it is shown how propagators and vertices can be renormalized to each order. In particular, the renormalized ferromagnetic magnon propagator arising in the present formalism is discussed. As an example, the thermal softening of the magnon frequency is computed. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Reactivation of structures inherited from previous collisional or rifting events, especially lithospheric-scale faults, is a major feature of plate tectonics. Its expression ranges from continental break-up along ancient collisional belts to linear arrays of intraplate magmatism and seismicity. Here we use multiscale numerical models to show that this reactivation can result from an anisotropic mechanical behaviour of the lithospheric mantle due to an inherited preferred orientation of olivine crystals. We explicitly consider an evolving anisotropic viscosity controlled by the orientation of olivine crystals in the mantle. We find that strain is localized in domains where shear stresses on the inherited mantle fabric are high, and that this leads to shearing parallel to the inherited fabric. During rifting, structural reactivation induced by anisotropy results in oblique extension, followed by either normal extension or failure. Our results suggest that anisotropic viscosity in the lithospheric mantle controls the location and orientation of intraplate deformation zones that may evolve into new plate boundaries, and causes long-lived lithospheric-scale wrench faults, contributing to the toroidal component of plate motions on Earth. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={In this theoretical study we investigate the interaction of molecular oxygen with β-cristobalite (100) surface, which is based in an ab initio interpolated full dimensional potential energy surface (PES) built from 2000 DFT points by using the Corrugation Reducing Procedure. This PES has been previously used to study the atomic oxygen recombination (Eley-Rideal reaction) over the same solid. We study the dissociative sticking and the reflection dynamics over the silica slab at different surface temperatures (Ts). Quasiclassical trajectories are computed for both thermal and state-specific reactants (Ts = 100-1100 K). O2 reflection is the main process at thermal conditions (&gt; 98%) although molecular absorption (diffusion) is also observed. Normal incidence collisions favor this molecular absorption. O2 translational and vibrational excitation considerably enhances the molecular dissociation, contrary to rotational excitation. The high surface corrugation and PES anisotropy allows understanding this behavior and the extension of the different channels. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

The first-order interference is derived from the energy distribution of DDCS and the resulting ratio spectra (H 2 to 2H) exhibit oscillating behaviour. The signature of first-order interference is also demonstrated in the DDCS spectra as a function of the ejection angle. We have shown that the constructive interference prevails in soft- and binary-collision regions. The single differential cross sections (SDCS) are deduced by integrating the DDCS over the solid angle as well as ejection energy.

In the present work the results of gravimetric data processing from this basin and surrounding region are shown. We had applied analytic signal techniques to the Bouguer anomaly along four profiles oriented perpendicular to the main axis of the basin, which extends from Sierras de Ulapes to the east up to Sierra de Guayaguas to the west, and over one profile nearly parallel to the basin main axis with a north-south trend, located from the northern part of the Mascasín basin to the southern part, near San Pedro structural high. Regional scale results show the location and depth of the main fault system to the east of Sierra de Guayaguas, and to the west of Sierra de Ulapes. At local scale, two faults were identified, that could be associated with the basin edges, and also one probable base fault with north-south dominant direction. The areas of dispersed solutions located on the eastern zone of the area, and represented with elliptic marks on profiles 2, 3 and 4 could be related with a stepped fault system in the buried basement, located to the west of Sierra de Ulapes. This setting is justified based on a positive Bouguer anomaly nucleus located in Ulapes and the surrounding zone.},

abstract={We propose a microscopic mechanism for the incommensurate phase in TiOX compounds. The model includes the antiferromagnetic chains of Ti ions immersed in the phonon bath of the bilayer structure. Making use of the Cross-Fisher theory, we show that the geometrically frustrated character of the lattice is responsible for the structural instability which leads the chains to an incommensurate phase without an applied magnetic field. In the case of TiOCl, we show that our model is consistent with the measured phonon frequencies at T=300 K and the value of the incommensuration vector at the transition temperature. Moreover, we find that the dynamical structure factor shows a progressive softening of an incommensurate phonon near the zone boundary as the temperature decreases. This softening is accompanied by a broadening of the peak which gets asymmetrical as well when going toward the transition temperature. These features are in agreement with the experimental inelastic x-ray measurements. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={A recently proposed two-orbital model for the Fe-based superconductors is studied using the Lanczos method on small clusters as well as pairing mean-field approximations. Our main goals are (i) to provide a comprehensive analysis of this model using numerical techniques with focus on the magnetic state at half-filling and the quantum numbers of the state with two more electrons than half-filling and (ii) to investigate the nodal structure of the mean-field superconducting state and compare the results with angle-resolved photoemission data. In particular, we provide evidence that the dominant magnetic state at half-filling contains spin "stripes," as observed experimentally using neutron scattering techniques. Competing spin states are also investigated. The symmetry properties of the state with two more electrons added to half-filling are also studied: depending on parameters, either a spin-singlet or spin triplet state is obtained. Since experiments suggest spin-singlet pairs, our focus is on this state. Under rotations, the spin-singlet state transforms as the B2g representation of the D4h group. We also show that the s± pairing operator transforms according to the A1g representation of D4h and becomes dominant only in an unphysical regime of the model where the undoped state is an insulator. We obtain qualitatively very similar results both with hopping amplitudes derived from a Slater-Koster approximation and with hoppings selected to fit band-structure calculations, the main difference between the two being the size of the Fermi surface pockets. For robust values of the effective electronic attraction producing the Cooper pairs, assumption compatible with recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results that suggest a small Cooper-pair size, the nodes of the two-orbital model are found to be located only at the electron pockets. Note that recent ARPES efforts have searched for nodes at the hole pockets or only in a few directions at the electron pockets. Thus, our results for the nodal distribution will help us to guide future ARPES experiments in their search for the existence of nodes in the Fe-based superconductors. More in general, the investigations reported here aim to establish several of the properties of the two-orbital model. Only a detailed comparison with experiments will clarify whether this simple model is or not a good approximation to describe the Fe pnictides. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Multiorbital Hubbard model Hamiltonians for the undoped parent compounds of the Fe-pnictide superconductors are investigated here using mean-field techniques. For a realistic four-orbital model, our results show the existence of an intermediate Hubbard U coupling regime where the mean-field ground state has a (π,0) antiferromagnetic order, as in neutron-scattering experiments, while remaining metallic due to the phenomenon of band overlaps. The angle-resolved photoemission intensity and Fermi surface of this magnetic and metallic state are discussed. Other models are also investigated, including a two-orbital model where not only the mean-field technique can be used but also the exact diagonalization in small clusters and the variational cluster approximation in the bulk. The combined results of the three techniques point toward the existence of an intermediate-coupling magnetic and metallic state in the two-orbital model, similar to the intermediate-coupling mean-field state of the four-orbital model. We conclude that the state discussed here is compatible with the experimentally known properties of the undoped Fe pnictides. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

Preferred adsorption sites, adsorption energies, and the relaxation of the surface structure were calculated using the all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method. We find that NH3 binds preferentially at a top site with the C3 axis normal to the surface. At this site, the N-Ag distance is practically the same for every surface, while the adsorption energy depends on the surface structure: 0.32, 0.40, and 0.49 eV per molecule for (111), (001), and (110), respectively. Additionally, the electronic structure and binding energies of NH3 Agn (n= 1,2) complexes have been calculated to investigate to what extent the formation of the weak N-Ag chemical bond might be determined mainly by local interactions.

The nuclear degrees of freedom are also included. A striking feature is observed when one analyzes the vibrational distribution of the residual H2+ ion: this vibrational distribution does not follow the usual Franck-Condon behavior when H2 is parallel to the polarization direction. The origin of this anomaly is related to interference effects. Such effects are more clearly seen in the fully differential electron angular distributions associated with specific vibrational states of H2+: for H2 molecules perpendicular to the polarization direction, the distributions clearly resemble those obtained in Young's double-slit experiment, while, for molecules parallel to the polarization direction, they show that the electron is sometimes prevented to escape in the direction of the radiation field due to the suppression (or confinement) of a given partial wave. The calculations also show that, at these high photon energies, the nuclear asymmetry parameter exhibits a reminiscence of Cohen-Fano oscillations when it is plotted as a function of photon energy. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={The mechanical spectroscopy response in Fe-25 at.% (Al + Si) and Fe-15 at.% (Al + Si) has been studied in the temperature interval between 800 and 1200 K. The solute grain boundary relaxation of aluminium and silicon was strongly dependent of the degree of order in the sample. A decrease in the order degree allows the development of the solute peak at around 1000 K during the cooling from 1200 K. Nevertheless, if the order degree is not decreased, the grain boundaries remain locked and consequently the relaxation peak does not appear. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The measured electron yields were studied for electron energies from 5 to 400 eV and observation angles of 30°, 60°, 90°, 120° and 150° with respect to the incident beam direction. Experimental molecular cross-sections were normalized to theoretical molecular one-center cross-sections revealing oscillatory structures suggestive of secondary interferences as evidenced by the independence on the observation angle. An oscillation interval for 30 MeV O5,8+ + O2 of Δk ∼ 4 a.u. is found, a value two times larger than that previously observed for 3 MeV H+ + N2. No obvious evidence for primary Young-type interferences was seen. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Polycation - polyethylenglycol copolymers (Semo B86 and Semo B124) were developed for therapeutic uses, especially for the masking of antigenic sites of human erythrocytes to decrease the risk of aloimmunization in blood transfusions. The aim of this work was to optimize the protocol for treating human erythrocytes using these two copolymers in order to improve their hemocompatibility The influence of the incubation time of human erythrocytes with both copolymers and the alterations produced to the morphology and erythrocyte aggregation capacity were studied using microscopy techniques and digital image analysis. Erythrocytes treated with both copolymers showed no changes in their cellular morphology but alterations in the size distribution and structure of aggregates, which were revealed by an increase in the individual cell percentage and a decrease in the percentage of large aggregates. These effects became more marked as the incubation time increased and were greater for Semo B86. These results enable a better understanding of membrane-polycation interactions and the optimization of the protocol to treat erythrocytes using these compounds. This finding may also be applied to the study of copolymers of similar structure and different therapeutic uses.},

This phase is characterized by the rotation of the TaO6 octahedra around the a axis. We show that this phase can also be detected from the dielectric response of the material. The present approach constitutes a powerful tool for a theoretical prediction of intermediate phases, not yet observed experimentally, in other Aurivillius compounds. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={The fragmentation of grains after large and severe deformation processes is an experimental fact that still lacks an easy, computationally economical and fast simulation model. During the last years some attempts to introduce microstructural features have been successful in reproducing a few experimental results. However the price in computer time is high and localization, as seen by experiments as geometrically necessary and incidental dislocation boundaries, is still elusive. On the current paper we implement a Taylor type homogenization model allowing neighbor grains to share deformation rates and spins by simultaneous averaging in coincidence with macroscopic values. We improve a previous co-spin model allowing the whole velocity gradient, of the spin sharing grains, to be compatible with the average deformation field. Misorientation distributions are compared with literature data. The results show the characteristic lognormal distribution with a close match with the experiments until a von Mises strain of 2.0. They are discussed in terms of the microstructural influence on texture development rate and components.},

abstract={We study the dissociative dynamics of O2 molecules on the Ag(100) surface. Initially, the impinging molecules are either in the spin-triplet ground state or in the spin-singlet excited state. The molecule-surface interaction is obtained in each case by constructing the six-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) from the interpolation of the energies calculated with spin-polarized and non-spin-polarized density functional theories, respectively. Classical trajectory calculations performed in both PESs show that O2 molecules initially in the spin-triplet ground state only dissociate for incidence energies above 1.05 eV. This result is consistent with molecular beam experiments performed in this system. Interestingly, our results also suggest that for the spin-singlet O2 dissociation occurs even for incidence energies as low as 50 meV. We propose the use of spin-singlet excited O2 molecules to improve the otherwise low dissociative reactivity of O2 at clean Ag(100). © 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={Density functional theory (DFT) is used to investigate the reaction pathways for H2S adsorption on Au( 111) and Cu(l 11) at low coverage as well as the full decomposition of H2S on Cu(l 11). On both surfaces, a weakly bonded molecular state is found with the S atom bond on top sites being molecular adsorption, a nonactivated process. The H-SH dissociation process is endothermic on Au(1 11), and all reaction pathways present high activation energy barriers which explains the extremely low dissociation probability of H2S on defect-free Au( 111) estimated from experiments. This scenario slightly changes for H2S/Cu(l 11): (i) dissociated configurations are energetically more favorable than the molecular state and (ii) the H-SR bond cleavage process presents a relatively small activation energy barrier. This is not inconsistent with low but nonzero reactive sticking probability of thermal H2S molecules reported in experiments. The complete energy profile for the H2S adsorption and full decomposition is compatible with the accumulation of S-adatoms observed experimentally. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

We found that the utilization of alkanolamines as chelating agent produce the segregation of metallic bismuth in as-prepared powders. On the other hand, acetoin, one of the hydroxyketones, showed the elimination of residual organics at low temperature, an earlier onset of crystallization, and no segregation of secondary phases during the whole crystallization process.

abstract={The microscopic mechanim leading to a low-temperature antiferroelectric (AFE) phase in H-bonded NH4H2PO4 is studied by means of first-principles calculations in the framework of the Density Functional Theory. We compute the total energy for atomic displacements following the ferroelectric (FE) and AFE mode patterns and also constraining the atoms in different cases. We calculate Mulliken populations for atoms and orbitals to show the important charge transfers and instabilities of the system. The AFE phase appears as a consequence of the H ordering in the O-H-O bridges leading to polarizations of the H2PO4 perpendicular to the tetragonal crystal axis and alternating in chains. It is found that the formation of N-H-O bridges with correlated charge transfers is essential in stabilizing this configuration against a FE phase polarized along the tetragonal axis, as e.g. in KH2PO4 (KDP). We also study de closeness of FE with AFE configuration energies and other hypothetical phases, which may explain the experimental detection of signals arising from small FE defects in the PE phase near the transition.},

abstract={One-electron self-energy in the t-J model was computed using a recently developed large- N method based on the path-integral representation for Hubbard operators. One of the main features of the self-energy is its strong asymmetry with respect to the Fermi level, showing the spectra mostly concentrated at high negative energy. This asymmetry is responsible for the existence of incoherent structures at high negative energy in the spectral functions. It is shown that dynamical non-double-occupancy excitations are relevant for the behavior of the self-energy. It is difficult to understand the asymmetry shown by the self-energy from weak-coupling treatments. We compare our results with others in recent literature. Finally, the possible relevance of our results for the recent high energy features observed in photoemission experiments is discussed. © 2008 The American Physical Society.},

The IAR parameters calculated by the CXSM and the CS methods agree with that of the CC results within 1 keV for all partial waves considered.

abstract={The early stages of the Coulomb explosion of a doubly ionized water molecule immersed in liquid water are investigated with time-dependent density functional theory molecular dynamics (TD-DFT MD) simulations. Our aim is to verify that the double ionization of one target water molecule leads to the formation of atomic oxygen as a direct consequence of the Coulomb explosion of the molecule. To that end, we used TD-DFT MD simulations in which effective molecular orbitals are propagated in time. These molecular orbitals are constructed as a unitary transformation of maximally localized Wannier orbitals, and the ionization process was obtained by removing two electrons from the molecular orbitals with symmetry 1B1, 3A1, 1B2 and 2A1 in turn. We show that the doubly charged H2O 2+ molecule explodes into its three atomic fragments in less than 4 fs, which leads to the formation of one isolated oxygen atom whatever the ionized molecular orbital. This process is followed by the ultrafast transfer of an electron to the ionized molecule in the first femtosecond. A faster dissociation pattern can be observed when the electrons are removed from the molecular orbitals of the innermost shell. A Bader analysis of the charges carried by the molecules during the dissociation trajectories is also reported. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA.},

abstract={We present an introduction to the Bidimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEMD) and its application to the denoising of DSPI fringes. The BEMD is based on the decomposition of an image in high and low frequency zero-mean oscillation modes, called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The decomposition is carried out through a sifting process which produces significantly fewer basis functions than the ones generated by the Fourier or the wavelet transforms. The denoising approach is based on the removal of the first IMFs, so that the filtered image is given by the residue. A normalization algorithm is then applied to the denoised fringes to reduce the oversmoothing caused by the filtering. The performance of this denoising approach was evaluated using computer-simulated DSPI fringes with different fringe density and speckle size, in order to calculate a figure of merit through the comparison with the noise-free fringes. The obtained results are also compared with those produced by other smoothing methods, and the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach are finally discussed.},

abstract={The variability of total ozone and UV radiation from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) measurements is analyzed as a function of polar vortex occurrences over the southern subpolar regions during the 1997-2005 period. The analysis of vortex occurrences showed high interannual variability in the 40° S-60° S latitude band with a longitudinal asymmetry showing the largest frequencies over the 90° W-90° E region. The impact of vortex occurrences on UV radiation and ozone in clear sky conditions was determined from the comparison between the measurements inside the vortex and a climatology obtained from data outside the vortex over the studied period. Clear sky conditions were determined from TOMS reflectivity data. For measurements outside the vortex, clear sky conditions were selected for reflectivity values lower than 7.5%, while for measurements inside the vortex, a relaxed threshold was determined from statistically similar UV values as a function of reflectivity. UV changes and ozone differences from the climatology were analyzed in the 40° S-50° S and 50° S-60° S latitude bands during the spring period (September to November). The largest UV increases and ozone decreases, reaching ∼200% and ∼65%, respectively, were found in the 50° S-60° S latitude band in September and October. The heterogeneous ozone loss during vortex occurrences was estimated using a chemical transport model. The largest impact of vortex occurrences was found in October with mean UV increase, total ozone decrease and accumulated ozone loss in the 350-650 K range of, respectively, 47%, 30% and 57%. The region close to South America is the most affected by the Antarctic ozone depletion due to the combined effect of large number of vortex occurrences, lower cloud cover and large ozone decrease. This region would be the most vulnerable in case of cloud cover decrease, due to more frequent occurrence of ozone poor air masses during austral spring. © Author(s) 2008.},

abstract={An electrorheological model is applied to results from Dynamic Mechanical Analysis in order to relate low-frequency dielectric properties to viscoelastic response. The model describes polymers with two phases at the mesoscopic scale, with polar groups embedded in one of the phases. Calculations use an electrorheological representation, based on the Voigt model, to describe the two phases. Low-frequency electrical and mechanical stresses are coupled through the permanent dipole moment of polar groups embedded in one of the phases. In the present model, low-frequency dielectric relaxation is calculated as the superposition of two Debye processes, corresponding to the interaction of the polar groups with the two phases. Induced polarization in the non-polar zones contributes only to high-frequency (relaxed) permittivity. The parameters of the relaxation processes are obtained from the electrorheological model using viscoelastic data from dynamic mechanical analysis. The model was applied to commercial EPDM (ethylene-propylene-diene monomer) employed as housing in electrical insulators rated at 33 kV. This rubber has two phases (amorphous and semi-crystalline), with polar groups embedded in the amorphous phase. Samples aged for 10 years in active transmission lines were studied, and compared with new samples. A good agreement was found between the calculated and measured dielectric spectra, within the low-frequency range where the model is applicable. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={A spin tunnel junction based on manganites, with La1-x Srx MnO3 (LSMO) as ferromagnetic metallic electrodes and the undoped parent compound LaMnO3 (LMO) as insulating barrier, is here theoretically discussed using double-exchange model Hamiltonians and numerical techniques. For an even number of LMO layers, the ground state is shown to have antiparallel LSMO magnetic moments. This highly resistive, but fragile, state is easily destabilized by small magnetic fields, which orient the LSMO moments in the direction of the field. The magnetoresistance associated with this transition is very large, according to Monte Carlo and density-matrix renormalization group studies. The influence of temperature, the case of an odd number of LMO layers, and the differences between LMO and SrTiO3 as barriers are also addressed.

A combination of experiments and numerical simulations reveals that the use of a surfactant monolayer (ML) of Pb during molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth at room temperature reduces the amount of interdiffusion at the Cu-Fe interface, retards the fcc-to-bcc transformation by about 2ML and substantially increases the films' coercivity. The origin of all these alterations to the magnetic behavior can be traced back to the structural modifications provoked by the surfactant during the early growth stages.

abstract={The modified relaxation time (MRT) function, which is based on a general linear viscoelastic formalism, has several important mathematical properties that greatly simplify the analysis of relaxation processes. In this work, the MRT is applied to the study of the relaxation damping peaks in deformed molybdenum at high temperatures. The dependence of experimental data from these relaxation processes with temperature are adequately described by a Havriliak-Negami (HN) function, and the MRT makes it possible to find a relation between the parameters of the HN function and the activation energy of the process. The analysis reveals that for the relaxation peak appearing at temperatures below 900 K, the physical mechanism is related to a vacancy-diffusion-controlled movement of dislocations. In contrast, when the peak appears at temperatures higher than 900 K, the damping is controlled by a mechanism of diffusion in the low-temperature tail of the peak, and in the high-temperature tail of the peak the creation plus diffusion of vacancies at the dislocation line occurs. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={As part of an inventory of potential interactions between effects of ozone depletion and climate change, a possible effect of ambient temperature on sun-induced skin cancers was suggested. Mouse experiments had shown that increased room temperature enhanced ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced carcinogenesis; the effective UV dose was increased by 3-7% per °C. The present investigation was aimed at studying a possible temperature effect on human skin cancer. Existing data on the incidence of human skin cancer were analyzed, as available from two special surveys of non-melanoma skin cancer in the United States. The incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer in the ten regions surveyed not only correlated significantly with the ambient UV dose but also with the average daily maximum temperature in summer. For squamous cell carcinoma the incidence was higher by 5.5% (SE 1.6%) per °C and for basal cell carcinoma by 2.9% (SE 1.4%) per °C. These values correspond to an increase of the effective UV dose by about 2% per °C. Although the precise nature of this correlation with temperature requires further studies, it can be concluded that the temperature rises coming with climate change can indeed amplify the induction of non-melanoma skin cancers by UV radiation in human populations. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.},

abstract={We study the two-impurity Anderson model on finite chains using numerical techniques. We discuss the departure of magnetic correlations as a function of the interimpurity distance from a pure 2 kF oscillation due to open boundary conditions. We observe qualitatively different behaviors in the interimpurity spin correlations and in transport properties at different values of the impurity couplings. We relate these different behaviors to a change in the relative dominance between the Kondo effect and the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya- Yoshida (RKKY) interaction. We also observe that when RKKY dominates, there is a definite relation between interimpurity magnetic correlations and transport properties. In this case, there is a recovery of 2 kF periodicity when the on-site Coulomb repulsion on the chain is increased at quarter filling. The present results could be relevant for electronic nanodevices implementing a nonlocal control between two quantum dots that could be located at variable distance along a wire. © 2008 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Texture evolution and shape memory behaviour were investigated in an Fe-30Mn-4Si (at.%) alloy showing the γ↔ε martensitic transformation. The alloy was subjected to different rolling and annealing treatments. Texture mapping and shape memory effect were performed in each case. After hot-rolling at 1000 °C, and for high values of accumulated strain, typical face-centered cubic (FCC) shear textures were observed for the austenitic phase. Further rolling at 600 °C leads to some texture reduction although the texture pattern remains unchanged. Alternatively, cold-rolling leads to stress-induced ε martensite and, after annealing at 650 °C, a similar FCC rolling texture was observed. Thus, different thermomechanical processes allow the development of quite different texture patterns that might be exploited for attaining novel shape memory responses. Shape recovery and yield stress were measured for the different specimens to analyze the role of texture and processing parameters on the shape memory effect. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Temperature-induced transformations under constant tensile load show a larger deformation, associated with the reversible martensitic transformation, for strips annealed at 700 °C and 900 °C than for the as-cast samples. This effect is partially ascribed to relaxation of internal stresses produced by the rapid solidification, some recovery of short-range disorder and microstructural changes related to Ti-rich X-phase precipitates. On the other hand, the strips show a columnar grain morphology and annealing leads to an increase of texture intensity related with the increase in elongation rate.

A comparison to artificially compressed Pd(111) and expanded Cu(111) shows that, apart from strain, substrate electronic effects play a very important role.

The BEMD method is based on a sifting process that decomposes the DSPI fringes in a finite set of subimages represented by high and low frequency oscillations, which are named modes. The sifting process assigns the high frequency information to the first modes, so that it is possible to discriminate speckle noise from fringe information, which is contained in the remaining modes. The proposed method is a fully data-driven technique, therefore neither fixed basis functions nor operator intervention are required. The performance of the BEMD method to denoise DSPI fringes is analyzed using computer-simulated data, and the results are also compared with those obtained by means of a previously developed one-dimensional empirical mode decomposition approach. An application of the proposed BEMD method to denoise experimental fringes is also presented. ©2008 Optical Society of America.},

abstract={Chemisorption of H and H2 on clean W(100) and W(110) surfaces is investigated from extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). We obtain properties of the clean surfaces [e.g., the well-known reconstructed structure of W(100) below 200 K] as well as adsorption energies and geometries of H atoms chemisorbed on both faces of W in very good agreement with available experimental data. From our DFT-GGA results, we build accurate six-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) which are used to compute dissociative sticking probabilities of H 2 on both faces of W through classical trajectory calculations. For both systems, our theoretical results agree with the available experimental data at low impact energies and are larger than experiments at higher energies. The main signatures of the sticking probabilities found in molecular beam experiments are reproduced, at least qualitatively, by our calculations: for instance, (i) the larger values for W(100) than for W(110), (ii) the nonmonotonic and monotonic energy variation for W(100) and W(110), respectively, and (iii) the dependence on incidence angle as a function of W face and impact energy. Our calculations show that dissociative adsorption of H2 on both W(100) and W(110) is a nonactivated process. In contrast with the widely accepted assumption that H2 chemisorption on W(110) is a purely direct process, we obtain that, at very low energies, adsorption takes place through an indirect (dynamic trapping) and a direct mechanism on both surfaces. Thus, the qualitatively different behavior of the sticking probability at low energies arises from a smaller contribution of dynamic trapping in the case of H2/W(110), due to slight differences between the corresponding PESs far from the surface in the entrance channel. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={We consider the ground state and the elementary excitations of an array of spin-Peierls chains coupled by elastic and magnetic interactions. It is expected that the effect of the magnetic interchain coupling will be to reduce the dimerization amplitude and that of the elastic coupling will be to confine the spin one-half solitons corresponding to each isolated chain. We show that this is the case when these interactions are not frustrated. On the other hand, in the frustrated case we show that the amplitude of dimerization in the ground state is independent of the strength of the interchain magnetic interaction in a broad range of values of this parameter. We also show that free solitons could be the elementary excitations when only nearest neighbour interactions are considered. The case of an elastic interchain coupling is analysed on a general energetic consideration. To study the effect of the magnetic interchain interaction the problem is simplified to a two-leg ladder, which is solved using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. We show that the deconfinement mechanism is effective even with a significantly strong antiferromagnetic interchain coupling. © IOP Publishing Ltd.},

All the reaction pathways present a sizable activation energy barrier, with the lowest being ∼0.52 eV (0.41 eV taking into account slab relaxation). In the corresponding saddle point of the potential energy surface, the S atom of the methylthiolate molecule is placed on Top sites and the H near a Bridge site.

abstract={The flux phase predicted by the t-J model in the large- N limit exhibits features that make it a candidate for describing the pseudogap regime of cuprates. However, certain properties, such as, for instance, the prediction of well-defined quasiparticle peaks, speak against this scenario. We have addressed these issues by computing self-energy renormalizations in the vicinity of flux phase. The calculated spectral functions show features similar to those observed in experiments. At low doping, near the flux phase, the spectral functions are anisotropic on the Fermi surface and very incoherent near the hot spots. The temperature and doping evolution of self-energy and spectral functions are discussed and compared with the experiment. © 2008 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={This paper presents a feasibility study to assess whether digital speckle pattern interferometry could be used as a possible technique to investigate the adhesive performance of coatings. The approach is based on the measurement of the deflections produced by a pre-notched coated specimen subjected to a four-point bending test. When the bending load is increased, a delamination between the coating and the substrate is propagated with its length depending on the adhesion strength. Experiments carried out with specimens having simulated delaminations confirm that digital speckle pattern interferometry can be used to estimate the delamination length. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In the present work the corrosion susceptibility of ion nitrided AISI 316L stainless steel was investigated for two different nitriding times and compared with the corrosion susceptibility of the untreated material. Plasma nitriding for short times (30 min) produced the "S" phase or expanded austenite (γN), with a thickness of ∼ 5 μm and a micro-hardness of 1300-1400 HV0.025 (6.5 times higher than the untreated material). Plasma nitriding for long times (6 h) resulted in the precipitation of iron and chromium nitrides. To evaluate the corrosion resistance of both untreated and nitrided samples, anodic potentiodynamic polarization curves and immersion tests were performed in 1 M NaCl at room temperature. It was found that the corrosion resistance depends on the nitriding time. Samples nitrided for half an hour developed a much better corrosion resistance - close to that observed in the untreated samples - than those nitrided for 6 h. Samples nitrided for half an hour showed high roughness probably due to the presence of sliding bands developed in the expanded austenite phase. These sliding bands provide appropriate sites for the developing of the corrosion process. This would explain the results obtained in the corrosion tests. Samples ion nitrided for 6 h showed a severe and massive surface damage due to corrosion. Ion nitriding of AISI 316L stainless steel for short periods of time (30 min in the present case) may be an interesting surface treatment process that efficiently improves the surface hardness of the steel with some reduction in its corrosion resistance. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The aim of this study was to analyze the strength of red blood cells agglutination, induced by autoantibodies in patients with Cold-Agglutinin Hemolytic Disease (CAHD), and the hemorheological profile (deformability and osmotic fragility) by the utilization of rheo-optical techniques. The strength of the antigen-antibody reaction was approached by the work required to dissociate mechanically red blood cells agglutinates. It is focused on the evaluation of the qualitative adhesiveness of cell approached by the dissociation kinetics carried out in a Couette flow (erythroaggregameter). The analysis was performed by recording the increase of the reflectivity signal as the agglutinates are dissociated by shear into smaller ones. A total of eight patients aged <54 years with recent diagnostic of CAHD detected by positive Direct Anti-globulin Test (DAT) and very low RBC counts at 20°C, were studied. Two parametric values were interesting: the dimensionless energy parameter and the characteristic dissociation time, which showed good correlation with hematological parameters. In conclusion, the dissociation method provides a powerful tool for estimating the qualitative adhesiveness of red blood cells agglutinated by autoantibodies in patients suffering of cold-agglutinin hemolytic disease and it would be very interesting to evaluate the severity of the disease. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={We have studied the ferromagnetic Kondo lattice model (FKLM) with an Anderson impurity on finite chains with numerical techniques. We are particularly interested in the metallic ferromagnetic phase of the FKLM. This model could describe either a quantum dot coupled to one-dimensional ferromagnetic leads made with manganites or a substitutional transition metal impurity in a MnO chain. We determined the region in parameter space where the impurity is empty, half filled, or doubly occupied and, hence, where it is magnetic or nonmagnetic. The most important result is that we found, for a wide range of impurity parameters and electron densities where the impurity is magnetic, a singlet phase located between two saturated ferromagnetic phases which correspond approximately to the empty and doubly occupied impurity states. Transport properties behave, in general, as expected as a function of the impurity occupancy, and they provide a test for a recently developed numerical approach to compute the conductance. The results obtained could be, in principle, reproduced experimentally in already existent related nanoscopic devices or in impurity doped MnO nanotubes. © 2008 The American Physical Society.},

A decrease in the orderdegree allows the development of a relaxation peak at around 1000 K during cooling from 1200 K. In contrast, if the order degree is not decreased, the grain boundaries remain locked and consequently the relaxation peak does not appear. The magnetic response both in the asquenched and after thermal treatment states was also explored and correlated to the microstructural state.},

An interesting feature of the procedure is that, for low damping samples, it can efficiently resolve experimental peaks that result from the superposition of different processes independently of the ratio between their relaxation strengths. This allows us to confirm that two different relaxation processes appear in molybdenum in the temperature range about 0.3 Tm, one around 840 K, and the other one near 1050 K. These can be related to diffusion and to a coupled mechanism involving creation and diffusion of vacancies, respectively.},

abstract={The impact-parameter dependence of electron capture by 20-MeV/u U91+ ions has been studied by means of channeling in a 11-μm -thick silicon crystal. Such ions are far from their equilibrium charge state in matter, and channeling offers a unique opportunity to study electron capture in conditions going from the extreme case of a single capture event (for the best channeled ions) to the case of multiple charge exchange events leading to charge state equilibrium (for unchanneled ions). For each incident ion, the charge states at emergence, energy loss, electron emission-, and x-ray yields are measured. The correlations between these quantities are studied. The data are reproduced by simulations based on the ion flux distribution. We show that the mechanical electron capture dominates at impact parameters smaller than 0.5 , whereas radiative electron capture is the only process occurring beyond. Specific features associated with highly charged heavy ions at intermediate velocities are discussed, in particular the ionization following capture into highly excited states and the local electron density enhancement due to the electron gas polarization. The measured impact-parameter dependence of capture probabilities is compared to continuum-distorted-wave eikonal-initial-state calculations, extrapolated to n>5 final states. © 2007 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={We used a multipolar code to create, through the dissipationless collapses of systems of 1,000,000 particles, three self-consistent triaxial stellar systems with axial ratios corresponding to those of E4, E5 and E6 galaxies. The E5 and E6 models have small, but significant, rotational velocities although their total angular momenta are zero, that is, they exhibit figure rotation; the rotational velocity decreases with decreasing flattening of the models and for the E4 model it is essentially zero. Except for minor changes, probably caused by unavoidable relaxation effects, the systems are highly stable. The potential of each system was subsequently approximated with interpolating formulae yielding smooth potentials, stationary for the non-rotating model and stationary in the rotating frame for the rotating ones. The Lyapunov exponents could then be computed for randomly selected samples of the bodies that make up the different systems, allowing the recognition of regular and partially and fully chaotic orbits. Finally, the regular orbits were Fourier analyzed and classified using their locations on the frequency map. As it could be expected, the percentages of chaotic orbits increase with the flattening of the system. As one goes from E6 through E4, the fraction of partially chaotic orbits relative to that of fully chaotic ones increases, with the former surpassing the latter in model E4; the likely cause of this behavior is that triaxiality diminishes from E6 through E4, the latter system being almost axially symmetric. We especulate that some of the partially chaotic orbits may obey a global integral akin to the long axis component of angular momentum. Our results show that is perfectly possible to have highly stable triaxial models with large fractions of chaotic orbits, but such systems cannot have constant axial ratios from center to border: a slightly flattened reservoir of highly chaotic orbits seems to be mandatory for those systems. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The model includes a topological mass term for the electromagnetic field and interaction terms between the gauge fields. By following the Dirac Hamiltonian formalism for constrained systems, the canonical quantization for the model is realized. By developing the path integral quantization method through the Faddeev-Senjanovic algorithm, the Feynman rules of the model are established and its diagrammatic structure is discussed.

abstract={In this work preliminary results of amorphous zirconium crystallization using ion beam pulses are presented. Energetic argon- and oxygen-ion beams generated by a plasma focus device were used to promote crystallization on amorphous ZrO2-2.5 mol% Y2O3 film deposited by chemical solution deposition onto silica glass substrate. The films were burnt at 370° C for 1 h in normal atmosphere previous to plasma irradiation. The irradiation was performed by means of successive pulses of ion beams. The evolution of the surface morphology and crystallization was followed by AFM and X-rays diffraction in a grazing incidence asymmetric Bragg geometry (GIAB), respectively. Argon-irradiated films showed highly nucleated cubic zirconia after 10 pulses. On the other hand, oxygen-irradiated films showed a delayed and less extensive cubic nucleation, but a more ordered structure and well-defined grains. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The interactions of H and H2 with W(1 0 0)-c(2 × 2)Cu and W(1 0 0) have been investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the effect of Cu atoms on the reactivity of the alloy. Cu atoms do not alter the attraction towards top-W sites felt by H2 molecules approaching the W(1 0 0) surface but make dissociation more difficult due to the rise of late activation barriers. This is mainly due to the strong decrease in the stability of the atomic adsorbed state on bridge sites, the most favourable ones for H adsorption on W(1 0 0). Still, our results show unambiguously that H2 dissociative adsorption on perfect terraces of the W(1 0 0)-c(2 × 2)Cu surface is a non-activated process which is consistent with the high sticking probability found in molecular beam experiments at low energies. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Characterization of the morphology of the ammonite shell is an old, relevant and open problem in ammonitology. Since many years ago the morphology and growth of ammonoids has alternatively been described in terms of the logarithmic law. However a description in terms of the variables or dimensions most commonly accessible and used (D: diameter or size; U: umbilical width; H1: whorl height; H2: whorl ventral or apertural height; and W: width of whorl section) is still missing due to the lack of relationship between these variables with those of the logarithmic law. In this paper we have found the relationship between the spiral logarithmic law and a multidimensional law which we have called the equation of state of the post-embryonic shell of Jurassic ammonites. This law is written in terms of D, U, H1 and H2 and has been tested on 25 species of Middle and Late Jurassic ammonites of the superfamilies Perisphinctoidea, Stephanoceratoidea and Haploceratoidea. Results obtained show an agreement with only 1-22% of uncertainty between observations and predictions, thus describing, at least, the 80-90% of the morphology of the studied ammonites. It was also concluded that H1/D and H2/H1, are fundamental parameters for describing the basic form and growth of ammonites in the equatorial plane.},

abstract={This work presents a study of the structural changes in aged EPDM (ethylene-propylene-diene monomer) from outdoor high voltage transmission lines. Samples were taken from failed and non-failed insulators after up to ten years in service on a 33 kV line. Infrared absorption, hydrophobicity index, dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA) and dielectric relaxation (DR) were employed as experimental techniques. The same experimental techniques were also applied to new samples of EPDM that were subjected to high electric fields (up to 14 kV/mm) for several hours. Results from DMA and DR techniques are in good agreement and, together with previous results from neutron irradiation techniques, suggest that the experimental data obtained from outdoor-aged and laboratory tested samples may be explained by a decrease in the degree of crystallinity due to the interaction between electrical and mechanical effects in the dielectric. The proposed model is based on the disentanglement of the crystallites by forces originated in the interaction of the electric field with the polar groups located in the amorphous phase of the polymer matrix. An alternative explanation, based on a relaxation process appearing at the interfaces between the filler (ATH) and the polymer matrix conflicts with several experimental results presented in this work. © 2007 IEEE.},

Basically no change with temperature is observed for the Drude contribution of the 1/5-filled compound. Optical studies allow us to investigate the formation of quasiparticles at low temperature for systems of different filling.

abstract={We present a general strategy for filling the missing data of the CATS benchmark time series prediction competition. Our approach builds upon a time-symmetric embedding of this time series and the use of a one-shot forecasting for each missing value inside the gaps from distant-enough delayed and forwarded predictors. In the extrapolation region we perform standard, non-iterated forward predictions. For modeling purposes we consider bagging of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We discuss two different implementations of this strategy: The first one is based on a simultaneous modeling of both large- and short-scale dynamics information, using (suitably delayed and forwarded) original CATS values and their first differences as inputs to MLPs. The second one follows a two-stage strategy, in which behaviors at different scales are modeled separately. First, the overall behavior at large scales is fitted with a smooth curve obtained by repeated application of a Savitzky-Golay filter. Then, the remaining short-scale variability is approximated using bagged MLPs. Expected error levels for these two implementations are provided according to performance on test data. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The western retroarc of the Southern Andes between 38° and 40° S is formed by a NNW-elongated ridge not associated with stacked thrust sheets. On the contrary, during the last 4-3 Ma this ridge was affected by extensional deformation, regional uplift and related folding on a very broad scale. Receiver function analysis shows that the drainage divide area and adjacent retroarc lie over an attenuated crust. Expected crustal thickness at these latitudes is around 38 km, whereas in this part of the retroarc the thickness is less than 32 km. The causes for such attenuation have been linked to a moderate steepening of the subducted Nazca plate beneath the South American plate, which is suggested by a westward shift and narrowing of the magmatic arc during the last 4 to 5 Ma. Gravimetric studies show that the upper plate did not react homogeneously to slab steepening, but ancient sutures and lithospheric discontinuities deeply buried under Mesozoic to Cenozoic sequences in the retroarc were locally reactivated. These processes resulted in an asthenospheric anomaly that correlates at the surface with the area of Pliocene to Quaternary doming, widespread extension and three radial troughs. Two of the troughs have accommodated substantial amounts of extension, but the third was probably aborted at an early stage. Moreover, the presence of an anomalous concentration of calderas and large volcanic centers over the proposed asthenospheric anomaly, and their age distribution, may indicate minor migration of the asthenospheric anomaly between 4 and 2 Ma through the western South American plate. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Model Output Statistics (MOS) refers to a method of post-processing the direct outputs of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in order to reduce the biases introduced by a coarse horizontal resolution. This technique is especially useful in orographically complex regions, where large differences can be found between the NWP elevation model and the true orography. This study carries out a comparison of linear and non-linear MOS methods, aimed at the prediction of minimum temperatures in a fruit-growing region of the Italian Alps, based on the output of two different NWPs (ECMWF T511-L60 and LAM1-3). Temperature, of course, is a particularly important NWP output; among other roles it drives the local frost forecast, which is of great interest to agriculture. The mechanisms of cold air drainage, a distinctive aspect of mountain environments, are often unsatisfactorily captured by global circulation models. The simplest post-processing technique applied in this work was a correction for the mean bias, assessed at individual model grid points. We also implemented a multivariate linear regression on the output at the grid points surrounding the target area, and two non-linear models based on machine learning techniques: Neural Networks and Random Forest. We compare the performance of all these techniques on four different NWP data sets. Downscaling the temperatures clearly improved the temperature forecasts with respect to the raw NWP output, and also with respect to the basic mean bias correction. Multivariate methods generally yielded better results, but the advantage of using non-linear algorithms was small if not negligible. RF, the best performing method, was implemented on ECMWF prognostic output at 06:00 UTC over the 9 grid points surrounding the target area. Mean absolute errors in the prediction of 2m temperature at 06:00 UTC were approximately 1.2°C, close to the natural variability inside the area itself.},

abstract={Electrical resistivity measurements, differential thermal analysis, mechanical spectroscopy and small angle neutron scattering studies have been performed on commercial QE22 magnesium alloy. The aim of this work is to resolve the appearance of Guinier-Preston zones and also to survey the small angle neutron scattering technique for various temperatures in this alloy. The coupling of all the employed experimental techniques in this work is crucial for detecting the precipitation of die Guinier-Preston zones. This is due to the strong changes in the microstructure produced by the main precipitation process, which starts at about 440 K and ends at about 640 K. We found that the temperature at which Guinier-Preston zones start to grow is about 473 K and that the dissolution temperature is 537 K.},

At room temperature, the aged samples showed embrittlement effects such as loss of toughness and reduction of fatigue life. At 500°C, beneficial effects of the synergy between temperature and strain cycling were observed. It is proposed that at high temperature in the ferrite the strain cycling can decompose the chemical composition fluctuations, promoting a demodulation of the spinodal decomposition formed by aging.},

abstract={We propose a one-dimensional model consisting of a chain with a t-J Hamiltonian coupled to a Heisenberg chain in a frustrated geometry to describe the appearance of the ferromagnetic phase which has been experimentally observed in vanadate nanotubes. This model contains a mechanism of frustration suppressed by doping suggested by Krusin-Elbaum [Nature (London) 431, 672 (2004)]. We study, using numerical techniques in small clusters, the relation between magnetic order and transport properties in the proposed model, and we perform a detailed comparison of the physical properties of this model with those of the ferromagnetic Kondo lattice model. For this comparison, a number of results for the latter model, obtained using the same numerical techniques, will be provided to complement those results already available in the literature. We conclude that it does not appear to be a true ferromagnetic order in the proposed model, but rather an incommensurate ferrimagnetic one, and contrary to what happens in the ferromagnetic Kondo lattice model, electronic transport is somewhat suppressed by this ferrimagnetic order. © 2007 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Recent angle-resolved photoemission experiments on hole doped cuprates reported new and interesting high energy features which may be useful for understanding the electronic properties of these materials. Using a perturbative approach, which allows the calculation of dynamical properties in the t - J model, one-electron spectral properties were calculated. A strongly renormalized quasiparticle band near the Fermi surface and incoherent spectra at high energy were obtained. Among the different current experimental interpretations, the results obtained are closer to the interpretation given by Pan et al. [Z.-H. Pan, et al., cond-mat/0610442]. The self-energy shows large high energy contributions which are responsible for the incoherent structures shown by the spectral functions and the reduction of the quasiparticle weight and bandwidth. According to the calculation, collective charge fluctuations are the main source for the self-energy renormalizations. For testing whether the self-energy obtained is compatible with transport measurement the resistivity versus temperature relation was estimated. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Concentrating on the 1 3 plateau (N=3) we unravel the microscopic structure of the domain walls which carry fractional spin- 1 3, both from theory and numerics.

It has been found that the mobility decrease of grain boundaries and dislocations is related to vacancy concentration reduction attained after the homogenisation treatment. Indeed, the largest vacancy concentration reduction is observed between 420 and 500 K. Unlocking grain boundaries and dislocations requires new vacancies, generated at temperatures above 500 K. In addition, a new damping peak related to vacancies was discovered at 490 K for an oscillating frequency of 1 Hz. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.},

We show that the spin gap and the critical temperature are strongly reduced due to the finite frequency effects of the phonon coupling transverse to the magnetic chains. We show that the long standing discussion on absence of a soft mode in some compounds can be naturally resolved within our theory.

abstract={Using a multi-scale theoretical approach from first principles, we show that the production of HO2 radicals in liquid water can be understood from the initial Coulomb explosion of doubly ionized water molecules. Based on the separation of time scales, we used three different theoretical models, each one associated with a specific time scale. The initial ∼1 fs of water radiolysis is taken care of with a Monte Carlo code whose basic ingredients are cross-sections. These have been calculated in the present work using the continuum distorted wave eikonal initial state (CDW-EIS) model framework. Our calculated cross-sections nicely demonstrate that double ionization of water molecules is one major event compatible with the experimental HO2 molecular rate production. The subsequent tens of fs following the double ionization of one water molecule of the liquid medium have been described with microscopic ab initio Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations. Dynamics shows that the water Coulomb explosion leads to the formation of two H 3O+ ions and an atomic oxygen atom. The final stage of the Coulomb explosion (up to the ms timescale) has been modelled with a chemical Monte Carlo code, assessing that the production of HO2 results from the O + OH → HO2 reaction in the liquid phase. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The effects of the repeated stress-induced transformation (pseudoelastic fatigue) on the mechanical behaviour and microstructure of Cu-Zn-Al and Cu-Al-Ni single crystals are presented. Several microstructural changes occur during cycling at temperatures above the martensitic transformation temperature M s in Cu-Zn-Al alloys. Bulk defects consisting of dislocation bands with retained martensite and intrusion-extrusion types of surface defects are observed. The fine characteristics of the defects, such as nucleation, density, as well as other microstructural features, depend on the working temperature, alloy composition, applied stresses and number of cycles. The presence of these defects alters the shape of the stress-strain curves in the pseudoelastic range for Cu-Zn-Al. Also diffusive phenomena strongly affect the mechanical behaviour of these alloys both in the parent and martensite phases, even for tests carried out slightly above room temperature. In turn, the kinetics of these diffusional processes has been found to depend on the density of bulk defects. Details of these processes are discussed and a simple model that describes the main characteristics of the mechanical behaviour evolution is considered. The interaction between the mechanical behaviour, density of defects and diffusion is discussed. In the case of Cu-Al-Ni, bulk defects are also shown to occur but the system is less prone to diffusion effects that could affect the mechanical behaviour. The defects generated during pseudoelastic cycling lead, however, to the inhibition of the γ′ phase when a transition between the bcc parent phase and a mixture of two martensitic structures γ′ (2H) and β′ (18R) is involved at the beginning of the cycling process. © IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={We consider possible routes to superconductivity on the basis of the t-J-V model plus phonons on the triangular lattice. We studied the stability conditions for the homogeneous Fermi liquid (HFL) phase against different broken symmetry phases. Besides the CDW phase, triggered by the nearest-neighbour Coulomb interaction V, we have found that the HFL is unstable, at very low doping, against a bond-ordered phase due to J. We also discuss the occurrence of phase separation at low doping and V. The interplay between the electron-phonon interaction and correlations near the √3 × CDW leads to superconductivity in the unconventional next-nearest-neighbour f-wave (NNN-f) channel with a dome shape for Tc around x∼0.35, and with values of a few kelvin. Near the bond-ordered phase at low doping we found tendencies to superconductivity with d-wave symmetry for finite J and x&lt;0.15. Possible implications for cobaltates are discussed. © IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, a new fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy is proposed to compensate for the effects of faults and to improve the overall performance for nonlinear stable plants. The FTC approach involves a commutation of a linear time-varying robust filter in the feedback path of the control loop in synchronization with an adaptive predictive controller. The decision of which mode has to work is based on specific conditions accounted in the control algorithm. In addition, the fault-tolerance ability of the controller has been further improved by a fault-diagnosis system (FDS) designed for detecting two fault types: specific bias at the sensor and time delay at the actuator. The FDS is developed by using wavelet decomposition and identification techniques respectively. An implementation on a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with jacket is presented as a simulation example for analyzing the effectiveness of the FTC linked with FDS methodology proposed here. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={The infrared spectra of the quasi-two-dimensional organic conductors α- (BEDT-TTF)2 MHg (SCN)4 (M=N H4, Rb, Tl) were measured in the range from 50 to 7000 cm-1 down to low temperatures in order to explore the influence of electronic correlations in quarter-filled metals. The interpretation of electronic spectra was confirmed by measurements of pressure dependent reflectance of α- (BEDT-TTF)2 KHg (SCN)4 at T=300 K. The signatures of charge order fluctuations become more pronounced when going from the N H4 salt to Rb and further to Tl compounds. On reducing the temperature, the metallic character of the optical response in the N H4 and Rb salts increases, and the effective mass diminishes. For the Tl compound, clear signatures of charge order are found albeit the metallic properties still dominate. From the temperature dependence of the electronic scattering rate the crossover temperature is estimated below which the coherent charge carriers response sets in. The observations are in excellent agreement with recent theoretical predictions for a quarter-filled metallic system close to charge order. © 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={An Anderson impurity in a Hubbard model on chains with finite length is studied using the density-matrix renormalization-group (DMRG) technique. In the first place, we analyzed how the reduction of electron density from half filling to quarter filling affects the Kondo resonance in the limit of Hubbard repulsion U=0. In general, a weak dependence with the electron density was found for the local density of states (LDOS), at the impurity except when the impurity, at half filling, is close to a mixed-valence regime. Next, in the central part of this paper, we studied the effects of finite Hubbard interaction on the chain at quarter filling. Our main result is that this interaction drives the impurity into a more defined Kondo regime although accompanied in most cases by a reduction of the spectral weight of the impurity LDOS. Again, for the impurity in the mixed-valence regime, we observed an interesting nonmonotonic behavior. We also concluded that the conductance, computed for a small finite bias applied to the leads, follows the behavior of the impurity LDOS, as in the case of noninteracting chains. Finally, we analyzed how the Hubbard interaction and the finite chain length affect the spin compensation cloud both at zero and at finite temperature, in this case using quantum Monte Carlo techniques. © 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={The correlation between the low-cycle fatigue behavior and microstructure of SAF 2507 duplex stainless steel has been studied. The cyclic behavior has been analyzed through the cyclic flow stress components, i.e. the effective and the internal ones, as well as the activation volume parameter. A change in the deformation mechanism occurs at Δεp = 1.5 × 10-3, where the accommodation of the plastic strain changes from the reversible to the irreversible bow-out of dislocations giving rise to a continuous increase of the internal stress. The analysis of the effective stress has shown that the interaction between nitrogen atoms and dislocations can be explained through a model for weak obstacles. Finally, above Δεp ≥ 6.0 × 10-3, dislocations on two {1 1 1} planes in the austenite can interact and form a well-developed cell structure, which increases the hardening of the phase. Consequently, the typical softening process characteristic of duplex steels diminishes with an increase in plastic strain amplitude. © 2006 Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract={The six-dimensional potential energy surface for the dissociation of N2 molecules on the W(110) surface has been determined by density functional calculations and interpolated using the corrugation reducing procedure. Examination of the resulting six-dimensional potential energy surface shows that nonactivated paths are available for dissociation. In spite of this, the dissociation probability goes to a very small value when the impact energy goes to zero and increases with increasing energy, a behavior usually associated with activated systems. Statistics on the dynamics indicate that this unconventional result is a consequence of the characteristics of the potential energy surface at long distances. Furthermore, two distinct channels are identified in the dissociation process, namely, a direct one and an indirect one. The former is responsible for dissociation at high energies. The latter, which includes long-lasting dynamic trapping in the vicinity of a potential well above the W top position, is the leading mechanism at low and intermediate energies.© 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

However, this approach has not been used to study dynamic processes through the analysis of temporal sequences of speckle patterns. In this work we present a study of the dynamic speckle phenomenon based on the multifractal theory. This study is carried out by calculating the Hausdorff dimension of the set of singularities of the Holder exponent. These parameters are determined from the maxima of the wavelet transform modulus of the scattered light intensity along the time axis, for each pixel of the sequence of speckle images. Calculations conducted on experimental data evidence a multifractal structure in the case of a fast drying paint and a bruised fruit. We extend this result by using a synthetic model, which reproduces quite well the first and second spatial statistics of the speckle intensity as well as the correlation coefficient evaluated from a temporal sequence of speckle patterns.},

abstract={The local phonon density of states (DOS) at the Sn site in tin monoxide (SnO) is studied at pressures up to 8 GPa with Sn119 nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (NRIXS) of synchrotron radiation at 23.88 keV. The preferred orientation (texture) of the SnO crystallites in the investigated samples is used to measure NRIXS spectra preferentially parallel and almost perpendicular to the c axis of tetragonal SnO. A subtraction method is applied to these NRIXS spectra to produce projected local Sn DOS spectra as seen parallel and perpendicular to the c axis of SnO. These experimentally obtained local Sn DOS spectra, both in the polycrystalline case as well as projected parallel and perpendicular to the c axis, are compared with corresponding theoretical phonon DOS spectra, derived from dispersion relations calculated with a recently developed shell model. Comparison between the experimental projected Sn DOS spectra and the corresponding theoretical DOS spectra enables us to follow the pressure-induced shifts of several acoustic and optic phonon modes. While the principal spectral features of the experimental and theoretical phonon DOS agree well at energies above 10 meV, the pressure behavior of the low-energy part of the DOS is not well reproduced by the theoretical calculations. In fact, they exhibit, in contrast to the experimental data, a dramatic softening of two low-energy modes, their energies approaching zero around 2.5 GPa, clearly indicating the limitations of the applied shell model. These difficulties are obviously connected with the complex Sn-O and Sn-Sn bindings within and between the Sn-O-Sn layers in the litharge structure of SnO. We derived from the experimental and theoretical DOS spectra a variety of elastic and thermodynamic parameters of the Sn sublattice, such as the Lamb-Mössbauer factor, the mean force constant, and Debye temperatures, as well as the vibrational contributions to the Helmholtz free energy, specific heat, entropy, and internal energy. We found, in part, good agreement between these values, for instance, for the Grüneisen parameters for some selected phonon modes, especially for some optical modes studied recently by Raman spectroscopy. We discuss in detail a possible anisotropy in the elastic parameters resulting from the litharge-type structure of SnO, for instance for the Lamb-Mössbauer factor, where we can compare with existing data from Sn119 -Mössbauer spectroscopy. © 2006 The American Physical Society.},

This device, which is based on only one dual-beam illumination system, allows the determination of the three components of the residual stress from the measured displacement field generated by the hole when specimens are placed outside of the optical bench. The description of the portable device and its principal characteristics is followed by the presentation of some preliminary experimental results obtained in thin aluminium plates subjected to a uniform uniaxial stress. An error analysis of the uncertainty sources introduced during the evaluation of the residual stresses, namely the error generated by the automatic data processing, the error produced by an incorrect location of the hole centre and the introduction of rigid body displacements, is also presented. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

X-ray diffraction, microhardness testing and scanning electron microscopy techniques coupled with semiquantitative energy dispersive X-ray analysis were used to characterise the nitrided samples. The results revealed that the current density during plasma processing has a considerable influence on both the compound layer formation and depth of the diffusion zone. Also, it has been shown that the geometrical configuration of the workload may affect the uniformity of the diffusion zone, giving rise to the presence of heterogeneous nitrogen distribution zones along it. © 2006 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.},

abstract={We have analyzed the dynamics of a single hole doped in a canted antiferromagnet using the t-J model. Within the self-consistent Born approximation we have found that the hole propagates at two different energy scales along the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic components of the canted order, respectively. While the many body quasiparticle excitation has its origin in the coherent coupling of the hole with the magnon excitations of the antiferromagnetic component, the ferromagnetic component gives rise to a free-like hole motion at higher energies. We have found a nontrivial behavior of the hole spectral function with the canting angle θ. In particular, in the strong coupling regime, the quasiparticle weight strongly depends on the momenta, vanishing inside the magnetic Brillouin zone for θ 60°. © 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Satellite-derived climatologies of UV index (UVI) and erythemal daily dose were determined for Argentina at a geographical resolution of 0.5° latitude by 0.5° longitude. Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer climatology of key input parameters was used to calculate the clear-sky ground-level solar UV irradiance. NASA Surface meteorology and Solar Energy cloud cover data were used to determine the UV attenuation by clouds. Two cases were tested: (1) monthly averages of total cloud cover and (2) monthly averages for three ranges of cloud cover percentage (0-10%, 10-70%, and 70-100%). Case 2, with smaller biases, was selected. Measured erythemal irradiance at seven stations of the Argentine Ultraviolet Monitoring Network was used to validate the satellite-derived climatologies, as well as to estimate aerosol parameters, surface albedo corrections, and UV cloud transmittance for the calculations. Annual average biases of the monthly mean satellite-derived UVI and erythemal daily dose with respect to the ground measurements are mostly within ±10%. The strong longitudinal gradient of UV levels toward the Andes Mountains is emphasized. Very high UVI and erythemal daily dose values are registered in the northwestern tropical high-elevation Andean plateau, with extreme monthly means above 18 and 10 kJ/m2 respectively, in December-January. Even northern low-elevation regions show averages over 12 and 7 kj/m2, respectively. On average, clouds attenuate the clear-sky erythemal irradiance by less than 20% for most of the continental region during all months. UV levels are considerably higher than those for equivalent regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.},

The treated surface was studied under Auger emission spectroscopy and grazing angle X-ray diffraction. The results have shown that a surface layer of 60 nm is strongly altered, and that the results depend on the frequency of the applied voltage and the pressure of contact between the surface and the cathode.

abstract={β-thalassaemia is a hereditary hemolytic disease, in which each clinic phenotype encompasses a heterogenic group of genetic alterations resulting in β-globin chain synthesis decrease or absence in red blood cells. Studies on β-thalassaemia carriers suggest the existence of decreased red cell deformability. The erythrocyte deformability in the blood stream is a well-known fact regarding blood circulation efficiency. Red blood cells may be considered to be viscoelastic and their behavior may be described according to complex viscoelastic parameters when they undergo oscillatory stresses. This dynamic behavior is physiologically important due to the in vivo pulsatile blood flow. The aim of the present work was to evaluate complex erythrocyte viscoelastic parameters in patients suffering from heterozygous β-thalassaemia in comparison with healthy individuals. Our results reveal that even though thalassaemia erythrocytes show a decreased deformability in the stationary state, in a dynamic state, hemorheological alterations are only evident at low oscillatory frequencies, i.e., at lower frequencies in contrast with the normal heart rate (60 cycles/min = 1 Hz), producing no significant alterations at increased heart rate. © 2006 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Hypertension (HTA) and dyslipidemia (DLP) represent major risk factors for cardiovascular and cerebral-vascular ischemic disease. The mechanisms through which they can induce vascular damage are both metabolic and mechanical. Hemorheological alterations in HTA are result of changes affecting both red cell intrinsic structure and their interactions with the plasmatic components. Several hemorheological determinants (biochemical, ionic, metabolic and rheologic) could influence and produce an impaired erythrocyte deformability determining an increased flow resistance in the microcirculation. The "Erythrodeformeter" allows obtaining the stationary and dynamical linear parameters of erythrocyte membrane by laser diffractometry. Stationary and oscillatory shear-induced elongation of cells leads to an elliptical diffraction pattern, its geometric characteristics being directly related to those of deformed RBC. Erythrocyte stationary parameters (Deformability Index, surface viscosity and elastic modulus) were obtained in stationary regime. Complex viscoelastic parameters (dynamic elasticity, dynamic loss, viscous and elastic components of the complex viscosity) were obtained when operating in oscillating mode. The diffractometric method is sensitive to detect pathological or induced alterations on RBC membrane, which can affect blood flow in vivo. The rheological parameters obtained give important information about the erythrocyte membrane and allow to detect and characterize erythrocyte alterations in vascular pathologies. © 2006 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={RBC flow cytometric analysis is usually used to quantify antigen content. Calibration systems enable antigen content determination by relating mean fluorescence intensity with the number of bound antibody molecules (equivalent to the number of antigen molecules). For that reason, antibodies must be used at saturating concentration, which may lead to agglutination when working with high density antigens. Then, forward scattering, side scattering and fluorescence will be increased, thus obtaining wrong results. In this work, the simple Langmuir adhesion model was applied. Flow cytometry was used to quantify GPA, a transmembrane protein present at high density on RBC. The fluorescence intensity of samples at different anti-GPA sub-saturating concentrations was measured. Sometimes, agglutinates were present and two peaks of fluorescence were observed, the principal one corresponding to isolated cells and the secondary one corresponding to agglutinated cells. In those cases, the principal peak was taken into account for the analysis. The GPA antigen content obtained for nine analyzed samples ranged from 3 to 13 × 105 sites per cell, which is similar to those values found in literature. Therefore, the Langmuir adsorption model enables us to determine the antigen content for the anti-GPA/GPA system on RBC membrane. This model could be used to quantify high density antigens in RBC and in other cells. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The effects of the antiferrodistortive surface reconstruction and the interface with a SrTiO 3 substrate on the ferroelectric properties of PbTiO 3 ultrathin films are investigated using an interatomic potential approach with parameters determined from first-principles results. First we show that a shell model developed for the bulk describes properly the surface properties of PbTiO 3 , in particular the antiferrodistortive surface reconstruction recently observed from x-ray scattering. We investigate also the effects of the surface reconstruction on the polarization behavior of ultrathin films under open-circuit electrical boundary conditions, showing that the surface layer participates in the ferroelectricity. Finally, film-substrate interface effects on the ferroelectric properties are investigated simulating PbTiO 3 ultrathin films on a SrTiO 3 substrate.},

By adjusting the displacement field generated by the indentation to an empirical model produced by a point force in a semi-infinite elastic medium, the values of both elastic moduli can be determined by applying a least-squares inversion method to the evaluated continuous phase distribution. The performance, accuracy, advantages and limitations of this technique are determined by evaluating the elastic moduli of bronze. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

As for Slater defects, their correlated formation energy per formula unit (5.2 meV) agrees well with previous model assignments, while the isolated defect energy comes out ≈3 times larger. Slater defect chains are accompanied by phosphate rotations and a basal lattice contraction. Observations of the latter near T c could thus be explained.},

abstract={We present a complete simulation of liquid water radiolysis by swift ions that takes into account explicitly the multiple ionization of water molecules. For high linear energy transfer (LET), we show that this process is indeed not negligible with respect to single ionization, which controls water radiolysis in the low-LET range. As suggested qualitatively by several authors, the rearrangement of multiply ionized water molecule is consistent with the production of atomic oxygen. We present a predictive and quantitative analysis of the possible role of this atomic oxygen. All radicals generated during the physico-chemical phase are followed during the chemical phase by means of the independent reaction time (IRT) method. The comparison of the simulation with and without multiple ionizations shows that the latter are responsible for creation of a large amount of HO 2 radicals and O 2 molecules. The simulated HO 2 yield GHO2 is in excellent agreement with direct optical measurements for Ar ions at 65MeV/u. The variations of the yield GO2+GHO2 versus LET are in satisfactory agreement with indirect measurements reported in the literature over a wide range of LET. The yield of H 2O 2 is also sensitive to multiple ionization for high LET projectiles, above 100keV/μm. On the contrary, for other species formed by radiolysis of water like OH, H 2 and eaq-, the yield is almost unsensitive to our considerations regarding multiple ionization. For all species, we observe that two projectiles with the same LET but different velocities produce different yields because of differences in the track structure. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the Hubbard model for the ABN-1 chain with filling 1 N, where N is the number of atoms per unit cell. In the strong-coupling limit, a charge transition takes place from a band insulator (BI) to a correlated insulator for increasing on-site repulsion U and positive on-site energy difference Δ (energy at A sites lower than at B sites). In the weak-coupling limit, a bosonization analysis suggests that for N>2 the physics is qualitatively similar to the case N=2 which has already been studied: an intermediate phase emerges, which corresponds to a bond-ordered ferroelectric insulator (FI) with spontaneously broken inversion symmetry. We have determined the quantum phase diagram for the cases N=3 and N=4 from the crossings of energy levels of appropriate excited states, which correspond to jumps in the charge and spin Berry phases, and from the change of sign of the localization parameter zLc. From these techniques we find that, quantitatively, the BI and FI phases are broader for N>2 than when N=2, in agreement with the bosonization analysis. Calculations of the Drude weight and zLc indicate that the system is insulating for all parameters, with the possible exception of the boundary between the BI and FI phases. © 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={The calibration of the erythemal irradiance measured by a Yankee Environmental System (YES) UVB-1 biometer is presented using two methods of calibration with a wide range of experimental solar zenith angles (SZAs) and ozone values. The calibration is performed through simultaneous spectral measurements by a calibrated double-monochromator Brewer MK-III spectrophotometer at "El Arenosillo" station, located in southwestern Spain. Because the range of spectral measurements of the Brewer spectrophotometer is 290-363 nm, a previously validated radiative transfer model was used to account for the erythemal contribution between 363 and 400 nm. Both methods are recommended by the World Meteorological Organization and we present and discuss here a wide range of results and features given by modified procedures applied to these two general methods. As is well established, the calibration factor for this type of radiometric system is dependent on atmospheric conditions, the most important of which are the ozone content and the SZA. Although the first method is insensitive to these two factors, we analyze this behavior in terms of the range used for the SZA and the use of two different mathematical approaches for its determination. The second method shows the dependence on SZA and ozone content and, thus, a polynomial as a function of SZA or a matrix including SZA and ozone content were determined as general calibration factors for the UV radiometric system. We must note that the angular responses of the YES radiometer and Brewer spectroradiometer have not been considered, because of the difficulty in correcting them. The results show in detail the advantages and drawbacks (and the corresponding associated error) given by the different approaches used for the determination of these calibration coefficients. © 2006 American Society for Photobiology.},

abstract={We use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to analyze the total ozone column losses in the Southern Hemisphere high latitude band (55°S-60°S) after Mount Pinatubo eruption in June 1991, based on measurements of TOMS/Nimbus7 satellite instrument up to April 1993. Different ANNs were trained to predict the expected unperturbed ozone values in the period June 1991-April 1993. The predictions of the best performing ANN were then compared with the measured ozone values in this period in order to determine the net Pinatubo effect. This comparison reveals a positive anomaly of(5±3)% in 1991 late spring and 1992 summer which disappears in early 1992 autumn. After this, a strong ozone loss develops in winter and spring 1992, reaching a maximum of (-12±3)% on September that is followed by a steady recovering to unperturbed values on late 1992. The observed anomalies can be attributed to the sulfate aerosols generated by the Pinatubo eruption, as they agreed with the aerosol surface area density measured by the SAGE II satellite in the latitude and period studied in the present work. The predictions of ANNs are in quite good agreement with those of an interactive 2-D radiative-dynamical-chemical model.},

abstract={We study the effect of diagonal and off-diagonal electron-phonon coupling in the ground state properties of the t-J model. Adiabatic and quantum phonons are considered using Lanczos techniques. Charge tiles and stripe phases with mobile holes (localized holes) are observed at intermediate (large) values of the diagonal electron-phonon coupling. The stripes are stabilized by half-breathing modes, while the tiles arise due to the development of extended breathing modes. Off-diagonal terms destabilize the charge inhomogeneous structures with mobile holes by renormalizing the diagonal coupling but do not produce new phases. Buckling modes are also studied and they seem to induce a gradual phase separation between hole rich and hole poor regions. The pairing correlations are strongly suppressed when the holes are localized. However, in charge inhomogeneous states with mobile holes no dramatic changes, compared with the uniform state, are observed in the pairing correlations indicating that D-wave pairing and moderate electron-phonon interactions can coexist. © 2006 The American Physical Society.},

The reflected laser intensity is registered in real time as the protein is being adsorbed onto the wafer.

This multi-electron system is treated within the framework of the independent electron model. The charge transfer process is described by employing the continuum distorted-wave final-state approximation. In this model, the final state of the collision is distorted by two Coulomb wavefunctions associated with the interactions of both the positron and the active electron (the captured one) with the residual ionic target. The water molecule is described by an expansion of monocentric Slater-like functions centred on the oxygen atom. Total cross sections are computed by using a partial-wave technique and compared with results obtained using the simpler Coulomb-Born approximation. Theoretical results for the production of H2O + ions in the final channel of the reaction through charge transfer processes (positronium formation and ionization) are also presented.},

The difference between the overheating temperature (TOH) and the thermodynamical melting point (TM) increase for increasing pressure. When particles move into the repulsive part of the potential the properties at TOH change. There is a crossover pressure where the volume jump becomes pressure independent. The overheating limit is preannounced by thermal excitation of big clusters of defects. The temperature zone where the system is dominated by these big clusters of defects increases with increasing pressure. Beyond the crossover pressure we find that excitation of defects and clusters of them start at the same temperature scale related with TOH. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={By means of extensive first-principles calculations we studied the ferroelectric phase transition and the associated isotope effect in K H2 P O4 (KDP). Our calculations revealed that the spontaneous polarization of the ferroelectric phase is due to electronic charge redistributions and ionic displacements which are a consequence of proton ordering, and not vice versa. The experimentally observed double-peaked proton distribution in the paraelectric phase cannot be explained by a dynamics of only protons. This requires, instead, collective displacements within clusters that include also the heavier ions. These tunneling clusters can explain the recent evidence of tunneling obtained from Compton scattering measurements. The sole effect of mass change upon deuteration is not sufficient to explain the huge isotope effect. Instead, we find that structural modifications deeply connected with the chemistry of the H bonds produce a feedback effect on tunneling that strongly enhances the phenomenon. The resulting influence of the geometric changes on the isotope effect agrees with experimental data from neutron scattering. Calculations under pressure allowed us to analyze the issue of universality in the disappearance of ferroelectricity upon compression. Compressing DKDP so that the distance between the two peaks in the deuteron distribution is the same as for protons in KDP, corresponds to a modification of the underlying double-well potential, which becomes 23 meV shallower. This energy difference is what is required to modify the O-O distance in such a way as to have the same distribution for protons and deuterons. At the high pressures required experimentally, the above feedback mechanism is crucial to explain the magnitude of the geometrical effect. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Recrystallization (RX) textures in FCC materials have defied modelling for quite a long time despite the major micro-mechanisms influencing the texture development are currently considered understood. FCC materials are coarsely classified in high and low stacking fault energy materials with a rather continuous transition between them. Both extreme kinds will give rise, after rolling deformation and later RX, to what are called Cube and Brass texture patterns. Besides long discussions, not still settled, about the influence of twinning on deformation textures, attempts of simulating RX textures have been unsuccessful. The current contribution will show SelfConsistent (SC) plus RX modelling taking into account accumulated deformation energy and misorientation angles between neighbouring crystals. Starting from grains characterized by previous SelfConsistent simulations, nucleation is probabilistically allowed on each crystal whenever the accumulated energy is larger than certain threshold. Grain boundary mobility is commanded by a probability function of the misorientation angles also calculated by the SC model. The modelling is able to predict the right trend for many of the literature experimental data without resorting to other more sophisticated variables.},

abstract={Some ancient metallic art craft, utensils, silverware and weapons are externally undistinguishable from modern ones. Not only the general aspect and shape but also some uses have not changed through the ages. Moreover, when just some small pieces can be recovered from archaeological sites, the samples can not easily be ascribed to any known use and consequently identified. It is clear that mechanical processing has changed along history but frequently only a "microscopic" inspection can distinguish among different techniques. Some bronze samples have been collected from the Quarto d'Altino (Veneto) archaeological area in Italy (paleovenetian culture) and some model samples have been prepared by a modern artisan. The sample textures have been measured by X-ray Diffraction techniques. (111), (200) and (220) pole figures were used to calculate Orientation Distribution Functions and further recalculate pole figures and inverse pole figures. The results were compared with modern forging technology results. Textures are able to discern between hammering ancient techniques for sheet production and modern industrial rolling procedures. However, as it is demonstrated in the present work, forgery becomes difficult to detect if the goldsmith, properly warned, proceeds to erase the texture history with some hammering post-processing. The results of this contribution can offer to the archaeologists the opportunity to take into consideration the texture techniques in order to discuss the origin (culture) of the pieces and the characteristic mechanical process developed by the ancient artisan. Texture can also help the experts when discussing the originality of a certain piece keeping however in mind the cautions indicated in this publication.},

The latter conclusion shows that normal energy scaling is not necessarily associated with weak corrugated surfaces. The results for rotationally elastic and inelastic diffractions are also in reasonable agreement with experiment, but they show that many more diffractive transitions are responsible for the observed structures than previously assumed.

Duplex treatments offer excellent possibilities to improve tool steel performance.

Ribbons have been prepared by Planar Flow Casting, wires by In Rotating Water Melt Spinning and strips by Twin Roll Casting. Microstructures and functional properties will be examined in relation with the microstructures induced by the technique.

abstract={This work describes the implementation of a Predictive Functional Control (PFC) algorithm on a ternary batch distillation column to control temperature by manipulating the reflux ratio. The PFC is tuned off-line by using simplified models obtained by applying identification techniques. The temperature set point is described by a polynomial related with an optimal dynamic behaviour determined to achieve the composition specifications. The separation performance is closely checked with the help of a soft sensor, based on a non linear Hammerstein model described in a previous work, which input is top temperature and the outputs are the estimated compositions. Additionally the model composition estimations are employed for calculating the accumulated compositions for each tank. Therefore a type of split range control for the corresponding valves of each tank is programmed in order to storage each component under quality requirement.

abstract={The different segments of the Andean thrust system have distinctive topography and inferred crustal roots. These two characteristics both depend upon crustal shortening, and on this basis they provide independent constraints for evaluating estimates of Cenozoic shortening obtained by balanced structural cross-sections of different segments of the fold-and-thrust systems. Three transects in the Central Andes are analyzed: a northern (22-23°S), a central (32-33°S), and a southern segment (37-39°S). Each segment shows different amounts of orogenic shortening, generated through a complex combination of thin- and thick-skinned thrusting. Based on known age constraints, different shortening rates are calculated for each segment. Estimates of crustal shortening derived from gravity and seismic-refraction data are used to evaluate interpretations of the structural style. In some segments, where alternative styles were proposed, the crustal-shortening estimates are used to identify the more realistic models. Crustal shortening, shortening rates, and the resulting topography decrease progressively from north to south. These variations cannot be fully explained by differential fore-arc rotation, as in the Bolivian orocline model. Instead, a close correlation is suggested between the age of oceanic crust being subducted and the amount of shorteningand propagation of the orogenic front toward the foreland. This fact becomes more important than fore-arc rotation farther south of the Bolivian orocline. On this basis, the present topography of the Andes, along the Nazca plate boundary, can be correlated with the age of adjacent oceanic crust.},

abstract={The present work reports on the results obtained on equal channel angular extrusion experiments (ECAE) done on a laboratory-cast Al-4%Cu alloy, in the T4 condition, and the use of Polycrystalline-FEM simulations to assist in the interpretation of the experiments. The experimental setup consists on a die of approximately 15 × 15 mm2 sections intersecting at 120°. Deformation at room temperature consisted of up to 5 passes with no rotation between passes. After each extrusion pass, the samples were cut from the deformed billet along planes parallel to the extrusion direction and the preferential orientations were measured on surface and middle layers. Three pole figures, (111), (200) and (220) were measured by conventional x-ray diffraction techniques and used for Orientation Distribution Function calculation and analysis. In addition tensile tests and optical microscopy have been performed in each sample to provide a good estimation of the parameters that enter in the modeling process. A finite element code specially developed to model large deformation processes (Forge3®) was used with tetrahedral elements and an elastic-viscoplastic material model to investigate the influence of the different strain paths sustained by different areas of the samples. The calculated distribution of deformations agrees well with the theoretical result. The simulation was used to assist in the selection of sample-cutting procedures for texture measurements and to provide the strain paths needed for self-consistent polycrystal modeling of texture development.},

abstract={Surface and ferroelectric properties of PbTiO3 thin films are investigated using an interatomic potential approach with parameters determined from first-principles calculations. We show that a model developed for the bulk describes properly the surface properties of PbTiO3. In particular, the antiferrodistortive surface reconstruction, recently observed with x-ray scattering, is correctly reproduced as a result of the change in the balance of long-range Coulombic and short-range interactions at the surface. The effects of the surface reconstruction on the ferroelectric properties of ultrathin films are investigated. Under the imposed open-circuit electrical boundary conditions, the model gives a critical thickness for the ferroelectricity of four unit cells. The surface layer, which forms the antiferrodistortive reconstruction, participates in the ferroelectricity. A decrease in the tetragonality of the films leads to the stabilization of a phase with nonvanishing in-plane polarization. A peculiar effect of the surface reconstruction on the in-plane polarization profile is found. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={We perform classical trajectory calculations on nonactivated H2 dissociative adsorption on Pd surfaces, using the surface oscillator model to account for phonons. We show that the role of surface temperature is closely related to the dynamic trapping process that enhances energy exchange with the surface by increasing considerably the interaction time before dissociation or reflection. Correlatively, the trapping process itself is enhanced by energy loss to the surface while it is quenched by energy gain. We show that, for a hot surface, isotopic effects in temperature dependencies are driven by the enhanced interaction time when the mass increases for a given energy and not by the ratio of molecule mass to that of surface atoms. Finally, we find that introduction of energy dissipation toward the bulk through generalized Langevin oscillators gives rise to molecular adsorption. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={We performed ab initio electronic structure calculations to study the stability of the Slater and Takagi protonic defects in the ferroelectric phase of KH2PO4. We show that the Slater defects are stabilized only when they are aligned forming chains of defects in the lattice, in accordance with the displacive model of the transition. In contrast, the Takagi defects are not stable in the lattice. The ab initio energy estimation for the Takagi defect (54meV) is in fair good agreement with previous phenomenological estimates. However, the calculated uncorrelated Slater defect energy (17meV) is larger than that from previous model assignments (5.2 meV), while the latter agrees well with our result for the correlated value per formula unit. This suggests that the earlier estimates contain considerable contribution from correlations between configurations of different H2PO4 groups. Our ab initio results show that the formation of chains of Slater defects is accompanied by phosphate rotations, and a concomitant lattice contraction in the basal plane. Therefore, we propose that the as yet unexplained anomalous lattice contraction observed in the neighborhood of the phase transition is due to an increase of the Slater defect population. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

A porous characterization in terms of micropore, mesopore and total pore volumes and specific surface area of the YSZ powders has been carried out by N2 adsorption at 77 K. The influence of three parameters (i.e., molar ratio of propanol, type of alcohol and use of acetic acid) on the textural properties of the samples has been analyzed. In general, an increase of the molar ratio of propanol leads to a growth in the specific surface area and a decrease in the average pore width. A remarkable contraction of the pores is observed as the molecular size of the alcohols used grows. The use of acetic acid produces a noticeably lower differential pore volume, which indicates that the influence of the hydrolysis on the process is not significant. Finally, values of fractal dimension indicate that, in general, the texture of the samples is mainly microporous. The apparently anomalous behavior of one of the samples is discussed as well. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We have used the classical trajectory and the time-dependent wave packet methods to study dissociative adsorption, rotational excitation and diffraction of H2 colliding with the Pd(111) surface at off-normal incidence. Both methods make use of a potential energy surface obtained from density functional theory calculations. The incidence energies investigated vary from 140to230meV. We show that, for fixed incidence energies above 100meV, dissociative adsorption decreases with incidence angle. We also show that molecules that are reflected in an excited rotational state take most of the excitation energy from the normal component of the incident translational energy. First-order diffraction peaks, in particular the out-of-plane ones, are found to be comparable to the specular peak, in agreement with recent experimental results. In most cases, classical and quantum results are in fair agreement, which confirms that classical dynamics methods can be used to analyze the scattering of H2 by metal surfaces at off-normal incidence, including diffraction. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={The recently developed technique of high-speed phase-shifting speckle interferometry combined with temporal phase unwrapping allows dynamic displacement fields to be measured, even for objects containing global discontinuities such as cracks or boundaries. However, when local speckle averaging is included, small phase errors introduced at each tune step are accumulated along the time axis, yielding total phase values that depend strongly on the speckle rereference rate. We present an analysis of the errors introduced in the phase evaluation by three sources: intensity errors, velocity errors, and speckle decorrelation. These errors are analyzed when they act both independently and together, for the most commonly used phase-shifting algorithms, with computer-generated speckle patterns. It is shown that, in a controlled out-of-plane geometry, errors in the unwrapped phase map that are due to speckle decorrelation rise as the time between referencing events is increased, whereas those due to intensity and velocity errors are reduced. It is also shown that speckle decorrelation errors are typically more important than the intensity and velocity errors. These results provide guidance as to the optimal speckle rereferencing rate in practical applications of the technique. © 2005 Optical Society of America.},

abstract={The polarized reflectivity of β″ - (BEDO-TTF)5 [CsHg (SCN)4] 2 is studied in the infrared range between 60 cm-1 and 6000 cm-1 from room temperature down to 6 K. Already at T=300 K a pseudogap in the optical conductivity is present at about 150 cm-1; the corresponding maximum in the spectrum shifts to lower frequencies as the temperature decreases. A robust Drude component is observed in the spectra which is much larger than comparable quarter-filled compounds; we ascribe it to the larger fraction of charge carriers associated with the 1 5 -filling of the conduction band. This observation is corroborated by exact diagonalization calculations on an extended Hubbard model on a square lattice for different fillings. A broad band at 4500 cm-1 which appears for the electric field polarized parallel to the stacks of the BEDO-TTF molecules is associated with structural modulations in the stacks; these modulations lead to a rise of the dc and microwave resistivity in 100 to 30 K temperature range. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

A slab of 80 Pd atoms is used to model the surface together with "generalized Langevin oscillators" to account for energy dissipation to the bulk. We show that the energy relaxation is fast, about 75% of the available energy being lost by the hot atoms after 0.5 ps.

abstract={The effect of ion implantation surface treatment in an austenitic stainless steel, AISI 304, with nitrogen and argon ions is presented in this work. The study concerns phase analysis, crystallographic texture, and in depth residual stress profile characterization by X-ray diffraction. In order to determine the residual stress depth profiles, a combination of the conventional X-ray diffraction technique, with several wavelengths radiation, and the pseudograzing incidence X-ray diffraction are used. Experimental data leads to the conclusion that the ion implantation did not create any new phase and did not influence the crystallographic texture observed before the implantation. However, concerning the residual stresses study, the results show that the initial compression residual stress profile observed in the nonimplanted surface samples changes to a tensile residual stress profile after implantation. A very important residual stress gradient is induced in the implanted surfaces and becomes more significant with the increase of ion beam fluence. In this surface layer, the tensile residual stress average value increases with the total fluence of ion beam. Ar ions seem to increase the residual stress profile more than N ions. The diffraction peak width evolution with depth is similar in nonimplanted and in implanted zones for both types of implanted ions. The peak width is much larger in the first micron of the surface layer, decreasing at a greater depth, reaching the corresponding peak value of the recrystallized material (6000-7000 nm). © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we also evaluate the performance of the multiplicative correlation operation between two speckle patterns that is proposed as an alternative procedure to generate the correlation fringes. It is shown that the application of a normalization algorithm to the smoothed correlation fringes reduces the excessive bias generated in the previous filtering stage. The evaluation is carried out by use of computer-simulated fringes that are generated for different average speckle sizes and intensities of the reference beam, including decorrelation effects. A comparison with filtering methods based on the continuous wavelet transform is also presented. Finally, the performance of the smoothing method in processing experimental data is illustrated. © 2005 Optical Society of America.},

abstract={The Capillitas batholith consists of porphyritic to equigranular granites, biotite-cordierite rich, and felsic granites, with andalusite and sillimanite. The host rocks are schists, which have developed hornfels bearing cordierite-andalusite-biotite. A gravity-altimetric profile constrains the regional tendency of the Moho as a S-N-descent of 0.13°. Applying a model of densities of 3300 kg m-3 for the uppermantle, and 2900 kg m-3 for the lower-crust, we ascertained depths between 45 and 50 km for the Moho. By the gravity inversion method (2 1/2 D) applied to the residual Bouguer anomaly, a depth down to 9 km from today's topographical level of the Cerro Negro can be assumed for the maximum granite root. Field, petrological and geochemical data suggest that the mafic and felsic granites have a common quartz-feldspar-biotite-rich crustal source. The anatexis took place at temperatures between 630 and 720°C, and pressures between 2 and 4 kbar, in the stability field of cordierite-biotite-andalusite-sillimanite. © 2005 E.

Seeds size, shape, color and texture characteristics are obtained by standard image-processing techniques, and their discriminating power as classification features is assessed. These investigations are performed on a database much larger than those used in previous studies, containing 10,310 images of 236 different weed species. We consider the implementation of a simple Bayesian approach (naïve Bayes classifier) and (single and bagged) artificial neural network systems for seed identification. Our results indicate that the naïve Bayes classifier based on an adequately selected set of classification features has an excellent performance, competitive with that of the comparatively more sophisticated neural network approach. In addition, we discuss the possibility of using only morphological and textural characteristics as classification features, which would reduce the operational complexity and hardware cost of a commercial system since they can be obtained from black and white images. We find that, under particular operational conditions, this would result in a relatively small loss in performance when compared to the implementation based on color images. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

However, for aggregation to be effective, the individual networks must be as accurate and diverse as possible. An important problem is, then, how to tune the aggregate members in order to have an optimal compromise between these two conflicting conditions. We present here an extensive evaluation of several algorithms for ensemble construction, including new proposals and comparing them with standard methods in the literature. We also discuss a potential problem with sequential aggregation algorithms: the non-frequent but damaging selection through their heuristics of particularly bad ensemble members. We introduce modified algorithms that cope with this problem by allowing individual weighting of aggregate members. Our algorithms and their weighted modifications are favorably tested against other methods in the literature, producing a sensible improvement in performance on most of the standard statistical databases used as benchmarks. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A higher than normal glucose concentration in a suspending medium may produce non-enzymatic glycosylation of erythrocyte proteins. This process can modify the viscoelastic properties of erythrocytes. In this paper, we studied the possible relationship between glucose concentration in a suspending medium and erythrocyte rheological parameters. Human venous blood was obtained from the antecubital veins of 10 healthy volunteers. Blood samples were anticoagulated with EDTA and centrifuged. Red blood cells (RBCs) were washed and subsequently divided in aliquots, which were incubated in vitro with glucose solutions of different concentrations. Dynamic and stationary viscoelastic parameters of RBCs were determined by laser diffractometry in an Erythrodeformeter. Aggregate shape parameter (ASP) of the RBCs was determined by digital image processing. Significant changes were observed both in ASP and in rheological parameters when the glucose concentration in the medium was increased, demonstrating that a glucose concentration as low as 1% induces alterations in the mechanical properties of RBCs. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The evolution of total ozone and surface UV radiation over some stations in the southern region of South America and in Antarctica in relationship with polar vortex occurrences is analyzed using Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer total ozone measurements and local surface UV data for the 1997-2003 period. The data are classified as a function of the position of the stations with respect to the polar vortex using equivalent latitude at 550 K isentropic level. The study of vortex occurrences showed that Ushuaia station (54.9°S) was located ∼40% of the cases in the edge of the vortex and 5% inside the vortex core during the winter-spring period. Concerning the Marambio (62.2°S) and Dumont d'Urville (66.4°S) stations, located on the shore of the Antarctic continent, the analysis shows a zonal asymmetry with respect to the center of the vortex. Marambio is located around 60% of the time inside the vortex, while Dumont d'Urville is predominantly at the edge of or outside the vortex. The evolution of the equivalent latitude of the stations in the anomalous 2002 winter presents a different behavior with respect to other years in the 1997-2003 period. The persistence of the vortex core above the stations is in average 1.8 days over Ushuaia and 7.1 days over Marambio in October during the 1997-2003 period with corresponding mean total ozone columns of 208.2 and 181.4 Dobson units, respectively. When the stations are inside the vortex, the total ozone columns are generally larger at Ushuaia than at Marambio in October during the 1997-2003 period. Finally, the impact of ozone-depleted air mass occurrences on ultraviolet radiation is evaluated by relating total ozone and UV erythemal dose measured at the stations. Twofold or threefold UV dose increases were reached in the 55°-65° southern latitude region during vortex overpasses, reaching maximum UV dose around 5 kJ/m2. The average increase of UV dose could be computed at the stations considered in the study when the measurement sampling and the number of vortex occurrences was sufficient. An average increase, of 67.6% of the erythemal UV dose was found in October at Ushuaia over the years 1997, 1998, and 2000. This value is strongly weighted by vortex occurrences over the station in 2000. At Marambio an avera e UV increase of 47.4% was found over the years 1999 and 2000. Midlatitude stations like Comodoro Rivadavia (45.8°S) are generally little affected by vortex intrusions. Nevertheless, the maximum UV dose can increase by more than 50% when the vortex passes over the station. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract={TILDA, a new Monte Carlo track structure code for ions in gaseous water that is valid for both high-LET (≈104 keV/ μm) and low-LET ions, is presented. It is specially designed for a comparison of the patterns of energy deposited by a large range of ions. Low-LET ions are described in a perturbative frame, whereas heavy ions with a very high stopping power are treated using the Lindhard local density approximation and the Russek and Meli statistical method. Ionization cross sections singly differential with energy compare well with the experiment. As an illustration of the non-perturbative interaction of high-LET ions, a comparison between the ion tracks of light and heavy ions with the same specific energy is presented (1.4 MeV/nucleon helium and uranium ions). The mean energy for ejected electrons was found to be approximately four times larger for uranium than for helium, leading to a much larger track radius in the first case. For electrons, except for the excitation cross sections that are deduced from experimental fits, cross sections are derived analytically. For any orientation of the target molecule, the code calculates multiple differential cross sections as a function of the ejection and scattering angles and of the energy transfer. The corresponding singly differential and total ionization cross sections are in good agreement with experimental data. The angular distribution of secondary electrons is shown to depend strongly on the orientation of the water molecule. © 2005 by Radiation Research Society.},

The dynamics results were obtained using a new potential-energy surface (PESS), which was based on density-functional calculations using a slab representation of the adsorbate-substrate system and a generalized gradient approximation to the exchange-correlation energy. A very accurate method (the corrugation reducing procedure) was used to represent the density-functional theory data in a global potential-energy surface. With the new, more accurately fitted PES5, the agreement between the dynamics results and experimental results for reaction and rovibrationally elastic scattering is not as good as was obtained with a previous potential-energy surface (PES4), which was based on a subset of the density-functional theory data not yet including the results for the low-symmetry Cu sites. Preliminary density-functional theory results suggest that the agreement between theory and experiment will improve over that obtained with PES5 if the density-functional calculations are repeated using a larger basis set and using more copper layers than employed in PES4 and PES5. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={Solar erythemal UV radiation incident on Argentina from tropical to high latitude regions has been measured with ground-based instruments as well as with the TOMS instrument on board of the NASA Earth-Probe satellite. These data permit validation of the UV index, a measure of solar risk to UV exposure, forecasted daily by CONAE (Argentina National Commission on Space Activities) and the Argentine National Weather Service. Model calculations of this index are also presented. In addition, we analyzed the UV effects from the Antarctic ozone hole passing over the continental part of the country using TOMS data corrected by a factor derived from the intercomparison of TOMS satellite data with those determined with Southern Hemisphere ground-based spectroradiometers. In this way, we obtained a rather comprehensive description of the amount of erythemal UV radiation and consequently of the UV index for the entire country, as well as the ozone total column and profile (the latter one at Buenos Aires). The results presented in this work were determined through collaboration between the following institutions: GSFC/NASA in USA, Institute Pierre Simon Laplace in France. University of Innsbruck in Austria and CEILAP, IFIR, CONAE, SMN, Universities of Rosario and San Luis in Argentina.

The superconducting α-(BEDT-TTF)2NH 4Hg(SCN)4 exhibits metallic-like optical properties down to 4 K. This is in contrast to the non-superconducting salt α-(BEDT-TTF) 2KHg(SCN)4 where a strong feature appears at frequencies of about 200cm-1 and temperatures below 200 K which indicates the opening of a pseudogap. In the anisotropic and poor metal β″-(BEDO- TTF)5[CsHg(SCN)4]2 we find a similar pseudogap in the optical spectra around 300 cm ' up to room temperature and the presence of a strong Drude-like contribution. Based on exact diagonalisation calculations of the optical conductivity on an extended Hubbard model at quarter-filling we argue that the proximity of the α-phase BEDT-TTF salts to a charge-ordering transition is responsible for the observed pseudogap. Our proposed scenario suggests that the different ground states, including superconductivity, are a consequence of the fluctuations associated with short-range charge ordering which builds up close to the quantum phase transition. In a 1/5-filled system similar features like the short-range checkerboard charge fluctuations are expected, but the Drude contribution is always present because the charge ordered state is strongly modified by the presence of mobile empty sites. © EDP Sciences.},

Glow discharge optical emission spectrometry was used to measure the depth composition of samples. The mechanical properties were studied by means ultramicrohardness indentation tests. Nitrogen atoms enter in the zirconia substituting to the oxygen atoms in the network.

abstract={We present a possible strategy for filling the missing data of the CATS benchmark time series prediction competition. Our approach builds upon an appropriate embedding of this time series and the use of bagging of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). We exploit time-reversal symmetry for prediction within the first four gaps, linking the missing state to symmetrically-located information both in the past and future. One-shot forecasting is then performed for each missing value from distant-enough delays. The suitability of the proposed embedding is assessed empirically by t-testing the goodness-of-fit of models built in symmetric versus asymmetric input spaces. Since this approach cannot be pursued for forecasting the continuation of this time series, in the right end we perform standard, non-iterated forward predictions. Expected error levels are provided according to performance on test data.},

The system allows the measurement of out-of-plane thermoelastic displacements generated when a specimen is locally heated with a temporally modulated CO2 laser. The defects can be detected by observing the perturbations which appear in the induced displacement field. Displacements are determined from the calculation of the optical phase distribution using a temporal phase shifting method and temporal phase unwrapping. The description of the TSPI system is followed by the presentation of experimental results that demonstrate that the detectability of certain type of flaws is improved by the use of thermal waves.},

Surprisingly, the angular distributions show that out-of-plane diffraction is comparable to in-plane diffraction, in agreement with our theoretical calculations.

abstract={Ion nitriding of steels is a process widely used on steels because it can give the surface important improvements in their tribological and mechanical properties attributable to the iron nitridings formation. On the other hand, on stainless steels, this improvement can normally be obtained by sacrificing their resistance to the corrosion. Nevertheless, several years ago, a new type of phase known as expanded austenite on austenitic stainless steels has been developed, a phase that have shown a high micro-hardness conserving at the same time the resistance to corrosion. In this work, we study the ion nitriding conditions to obtain this type of phase on stainless steel AISI 316L. We have found that the expanded austenite was completely developed after only 30 min of ion nitriding. We obtain images of the surface treated, showing the austenitic nature of the phase, with slip bans that confirms the stress state originated in the expansion of the original austenitic lattice during the ion nitriding process. Further studies of thermal treatment at different temperatures have shown that this expanded austenite developed on AISI 316L is stable for 40 h at temperatures of 300 °C, conserving their structure, X-ray diffractogram and a micro-hardness between 1200 and 1400 HV0.025. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This poses a linear Bayesian problem, whose associated system of equations can be solved directly or by iterative procedures. The ability of the described method to predict the geoid elevation over the gravity stations is assessed in a synthetic example; and in the application to a real case, a gravity-enhanced geoid is mapped for an area of Buenos Aires province, Argentina, where local features are put in evidence. © 2004 RAS.},

In this model, bosonic chains are connected to fermionic chains by two types of generalized Andreev couplings. It is shown that for both types of couplings the long-distance pairing correlations are enhanced. Near quarter-filling, this effect is much larger for the splitting of a pair in electrons which go to the two neighboring fermionic chains than for a pair hopping process. It is argued that the pairing enhancement is a result of the nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion which tunes the competition between pairing and charge ordering.},

abstract={A gravimetric and magnetometric study was carried out in the north-eastern portion of the Cuyania terrane and adjacent Pampia terrane. Gravimetric models permitted to interpret the occurrence of dense materials at the suture zone between the latter terranes. Magnetometric models led to propose the existence of different susceptibilities on either side of the suture. The Curie temperature point depth, representing the lower boundary of the magnetised crust, was found to be located at 25 km, consistent with the lower limit of the brittle crust delineated by seismic data; this unusually thick portion of the crust is thought to release stress producing significant seismicity. Moho depths determined from seismic studies near western Sierras Pampeanas are significantly greater than those obtained from gravimetric crustal models. Considering mass and gravity changes originated by the flat-slab Nazca plate along Cuyania and western Pampia terranes, it is possible to reconcile Moho thickness obtained either by seismic or by gravity data. Thus, topography and crustal thickness are controlled not only by erosion and shortening but by upper mantle heterogeneities produced by: (a) the oceanic subducted Nazca plate with "normal slope" also including asthenospheric materials between both continental and oceanic lithospheres; (b) flat-slab subducted Nazca plate (as shown in this work) without significant asthenospheric materials between both lithospheres. These changes influence the relationship between topographic altitudes and crustal thickness in different ways, differing from the simple Airy system relationship and modifying the crustal scale shortening calculation. These changes are significantly enlarged in the study area. Future changes in Nazca Plate slope will produce changes in the isostatic balance. © 2004 International Association for Gondwana Research, Japan.},

abstract={A gravity and magnetic survey has been carried out with the purpose of investigating geophysical features of the crusts beneath three geological provinces in western Argentina: Cuyo Precordillera, the Sierras Pampeanas of San Juan and La Rioja, and Famatina System, the results of which are displayed in three maps: Bouguer anomaly, total field magnetic anomaly and total field reduced to the pole. The top and bottom boundaries of the magnetized crust were calculated from power-density spectra of the total-field anomalies from our terrestrial database in 90 2D windows. The depths obtained for the bottom of magnetized crust are assumed to correspond to Curie point depths. The values thus obtained for the Precordillera range between 29 and 40 km, whereas for the Sierras Pampeanas, in the Sierra de Pie de Palo, and other mountain chains along the Bermejo-Desaguadero lineament or Valle Fértil lineament, such depth ranges between 20 and 35 km. These results are consistent with Curie point depths determined on different continental regions in the world. A map of regional heat flow has been prepared in the present work based on the depth of the Curie point isotherm, which shows that heat flow patterns in Precordillera are different from those found in Sierras Pampeanas. A significant heat flow extending in Northeast-Southwest direction seems to be directly related to Juan Fernández Ridge trace. The results of the present investigations also point out a possible relationship between the base of the magnetized crust and the boundary separating the brittle from the ductile crustal regime. © 2004 International Association for Gondwana Research, Japan.},

The pyranometer and a biometer were placed on a rotation device in order to modify the detector inclination in the solar plane. We determined in detail a systematic difference between the detector inclination at the highest intensity and the detector inclination in the Sun direction. The maximum intensity was always registered at a detector inclination greater than the solar elevation. This can be explained by the varying relation between the diffuse and direct contributions to the irradiance at different inclinations. For total UV irradiance, the absolute difference between the detector inclination at maximum intensity and the solar elevation is less than 12° for solar elevations greater than 30° and for erythemal irradiance less than 20°. The relative difference of the intensities is less than 2% for total UV irradiance and less than 5% for erythemal irradiance. For smaller solar elevations both differences grow rapidly.},

After the first few cycles a pronounced cyclic softening that continues up to failure is observed for all these steels. Although this softening is coincident with similar behaviour observed in commercial martensitic alloys, reduced activation steels present some remarkable different features. Almost all cyclic curves never reach a saturation stress and after few cycles, dependent on the total strain range, they converge in a common softening stage independent of the strain range. The mechanism governing this softening stage is almost independent of temperatures below 450 °C. The cyclic softening observed in the reduced activation steels is more pronounced than for MANET II and commercial martensitic steels. This fact is related to the difference in the Martensite Start temperature. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The interaction of H and H2 with NiAl(110) was studied by density functional theory (DFT). The NiAl alloy was crystallized in the CsCl structure, which consisted of two interpenetrating simple-cubic lattices. It was observed that the energy barriers for dissociation vary by more than 1 eV between the most and the least reactive sites. The results show that a corrugation of ∼0.3 Å is twice as large as the value obtained from experiment at the lowest energies.},

This novel approach for measuring residual stresses has the advantage of being nondestructive and can be easily applied to in situ tests. The description of the combined system is followed by the presentation of preliminary results which illustrate the ability of both techniques to quantify residual stress fields and also to determine their principal directions. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This paper presents comparisons between full-field numerical results and homogenization estimates for the effective behaviour and statistical fluctuations of the stress and strain-rate fields in viscoplastic polycrystals. The full-field simulations make use of a recently introduced technique based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, while the homogenization results follow from the 'second-order' technique incorporating information about the averages and fluctuations of the fields in a suitably chosen 'linear comparison polycrystal', together with the standard self-consistent (SC) approximation for the linear comparison medium. An application is given for a model two-dimensional power-law polycrystal, for which exact estimates are available in the limit of linearly viscous behaviour. These exact results demonstrate the accuracy of the FFT method, even for relatively large values of the grain anisotropy parameter when the field fluctuations become significant. On the other hand, the 'second-order' SC estimates for both the effective behaviour and the statistical fluctuations of the stress and strain-rate fields in viscoplastic polycrystals are found to be in good agreement with the corresponding FFT results. This is the case even for strongly nonlinear systems with low strain-rate sensitivities, where the field fluctuations are found to be large, and where other, earlier versions of the SC approximation are shown to fail.},

This approach incorporates secular changes into the modeling process through an external driving parameter, whose temporal behavior is shown to correspond in this case to the long-term trend of the sunspot record. Our method is able to reduce by approximately 13% the prediction error of this series when compared to the standard stationary approach. Such a reduction is remarkable in view of the benchmark status of the sunspot record in the statistical literature and, moreover, the fact that this gain is obtained over the performance of an already very competitive modeling technique based on ensembles of artificial neural networks.},

abstract={The major factors causing differences between satellite-derived and ground-based ultraviolet (UV) erythemal irradiances and doses are discussed. Measurements totaling more than 4700 days during 1997-1999 were obtained at 8 stations (22°S-64°S) of the Argentine UV Monitoring Network. The satellite retrieval uses radiative transfer calculations for cloud- and aerosol-free conditions multiplied by correction factors for clouds and aerosols. Key parameters are total ozone, cloud optical depth, and surface albedo derived from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS). When no aerosol correction is applied, systematic differences of satellite-derived erythemal irradiance relative to ground-based measurements amount to +1% at a tropical high-altitude Andean location, +10% at stations in the central Pampas, +5% at southern Patagonian sites, and -7% at the southernmost continental and Antarctic stations with varying snow cover. When an aerosol correction is applied by estimating "minimum" and "maximum" aerosol loading, the systematic differences are within ±10% for all "snow-free" stations. To reduce the differences at places with varying snow conditions, an "average surface-albedo climatology" must be used instead the TOMS climatology of minimum albedo. Although the statistical uncertainty of the differences increases with TOMS reflectivity, the systematic difference is independent of TOMS reflectivity for most of the stations, so on average the comparison for cloudy situations is as good as for clear-sky conditions. The comparison for daily erythemal doses gives similar results with smaller statistical uncertainty. Measured uncertainties are in agreement with a theoretical analysis. For most locations, well-characterized ground-based instruments should agree with TOMS satellite estimations within 10% if aerosol corrections are known.

abstract={Cyclic tests with different total strain amplitudes were conducted on Zircaloy-4 at room temperature. The results show that cyclic softening behaviour is the main mechanical feature observed in this material. A detailed analysis of the hysteresis loops was conducted in order to determine the friction and back stresses. The friction stress corresponds to the resistance which the dislocations have to overcome to keep moving in the lattice. The back stress depends on the density of long-range impenetrable obstacles that are created by the dislocations movement such as pile-ups. The cycling softening that Zircaloy-4 exhibits is related with the decrease of the friction stress. Moreover, the independence of the friction stress behaviour on the total strain amplitude as well as the influence of thermal treatment on interrupted cyclic tests permit the conclusion that the unlocking of dislocations from oxygen atoms is responsible for the observed softening. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Background: To define parameters characterizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) agglutination properties is a topic of high relevance in diagnostic immunohematology. Material and Methods: Laser backscattering is used to analyze the agglutinates' dissociation process. The suspension in a Couette flow is exposed to different shear forces, and the backscattering light intensity is quantified. Parameters characterizing antibody agglutination properties are obtained. Results: Parameters obtained by the rheo-optical method characterize antibodies agglutination properties. They are proportional to antibody concentration. The approaches allows to classify mAb according to the agglutination strength as high-, medium- and low-strength antibodies and were successfully applied to determine parameters for polyclonal (anti-A, anti-D) and monoclonal (anti-A, anti-B, anti-AB, anti-H, anti-Le, anti-P, anti-M, anti-N, anti-GPA and anti-T) antibodies. The first approach was also used to discriminate blood group A phenotypes. Estimation of the linear regression slope is an interesting parameter to evaluate the strength of the reaction which may depend on density of antigenic sites on the cell membrane but also on the specificity of the cell antigen. Conclusions: The biophysical approach presented in this work can provide new and interesting information about intercellular adhesion and, consequently, may suggest new questions on the energies involved in immunological red blood cell agglutination. Such information on the energy existing between membranes agglutinated by mAb may help to understand many important physiological and pathological phenomena, but, particularly, it will be useful in the quality control of monoclonal antibodies.},

abstract={We study the consequences of antineutrino trapping in hot quark matter for quark star configurations with possible diquark condensation. Due to the conditions of charge neutrality and β-equilibrium the flavor asymmetry increases with the number density of trapped antineutrinos. Above a critical value of the antineutrino chemical potential of 30 MeV, diquark condensation is inhibited at low densities and a two-phase structure emerges: a superconducting quark matter core surrounded by a shell of normal quark matter. When the quark star cools below a temperature T ∼ 1 MeV, the mean free path of antineutrinos becomes larger than the thickness of the normal quark matter shell so that they become suddenly untrapped. By comparing the masses of configurations with the same baryon number we estimate that the release of energy due to the antineutrino untrapping transition can be in the range of 1051-1052 erg.},

In contrast to the standard setup which is designed to measure the transport through the dot, the channel conductance reveals Coulomb blockade dips rather then peaks due to the Fano-like backscattering. At zero temperature the Kondo effect leads to the formation of broad valleys of small conductance corresponding to an odd number of electrons on the dot. By applying a magnetic field in the dot region we find two dips corresponding to a total suppression in the conductance of spins up and down separated by an energy of the order of the Coulomb interaction. This provides a possibility of a perfect spin filter.},

abstract={Friedel oscillations induced by open boundary conditions in a two-band Hubbard model for CuO chains are numerically studied. We find that for physically realistic parameters and close to quarter filling, these oscillations have a 2kF modulation according with experimental results on YBa2Cu3O7-δ. In addition, we predict that, for the same parameters, as hole doping is reduced from quarter filling to half filling, Friedel oscillations would acquire a 4kF modulation, typical of a strongly correlated electron regime. The 4k F modulation also dominates in the electron doped region. The range of parameters varied is very broad, and hence the results reported could apply to other cuprates and other strongly correlated compounds with quasi-one-dimensional structures. On a more theoretical side, we stress the fact that the copper and oxygen subsystems should be described by two different Luttinger liquid exponents.},

abstract={We evaluate the use of a smoothed space-frequency distribution (SSFD) to retrieve optical phase maps in digital speckle pattern interferometry (DSPI). The performance of this method is tested by use of computer-simulated DSPI fringes. Phase gradients are found along a pixel path from a single DSPI image, and the phase map is finally determined by integration. This technique does not need the application of a phase unwrapping algorithm or the introduction of carrier fringes in the interferometer. It is shown that a Wigner-Ville distribution with a smoothing Gaussian kernel gives more-accurate results than methods based on the continuous wavelet transform. We also discuss the influence of filtering on smoothing of the DSPI fringes and some additional limitations that emerge when this technique is applied. The performance of the SSFD method for processing experimental data is then illustrated.},

As a new reference can be taken after some pre-defined time, it is important to know how this time intervals influence the accuracy of the TPUA. An error analysis is then necessary to determine an optimum re-reference rate. This analysis has been carried out using three error sources: intensity, velocity, and speckle decorrelation. The small phase errors introduced by these error sources are accumulated along the time yielding total phase values that depend strongly on a re-reference rate. For the most common phase steeping algorithms, these errors are analysed using a computer simulation of the speckle and experimental results confirm the expected results.},

abstract={The dynamical properties of an extended Hubbard model, which is relevant to quarter-filled layered organic molecular crystals, are analyzed. We have computed the dynamical charge correlation function, spectral density, and optical conductivity using Lanczos diagonalization and large-N techniques. As the ratio of the nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion, V, to the hopping integral, t, increases there is a transition from a metallic phase to a charge-ordered phase. Dynamical properties close to the ordering transition are found to differ from the ones expected in a conventional metal. Large-N calculations display an enhancement of spectral weight at low frequencies as the system is driven closer to the charge-ordering transition in agreement with Lanczos calculations. As V is increased the charged correlation function displays a collective mode which, for wave vectors close to (π,π), increases in amplitude and softens as the charge-ordering transition is approached. We propose that inelastic x-ray scattering be used to detect this mode. Large-N calculations predict superconductivity with d xy symmetry close to the ordering transition. We find that this is consistent with Lanczos diagonalization calculations, on lattices of 20 sites, which find that the binding energy of two holes becomes negative close to the charge-ordering transition.},

abstract={Biological action spectra are commonly used to assess health and ecosystem responses to increases in spectral ultraviolet (UV) irradiances resulting from stratospheric ozone (O3) reductions. For each action spectrum, a normalized sensitivity coefficient (the radiation amplification factor [RAF]) can be calculated as the relative increase in biologically active UV irradiance for a given relative decrease in the atmospheric O3 column amount. We use a detailed radiative transfer model to calculate the dependence of RAF on the O3 column amount and the solar zenith angle (and, therefore, implicitly on latitude and season) for several commonly used action spectra. A simple analytical model is used to interpret the results in terms of the semilogarithmic slope of the action spectra in the UV-B and UV-A wavelength ranges. We also show that RAF may be overestimated substantially if the UV-A portion of an action spectrum is significant but is neglected. This is illustrated using several idealized action spectra as well as published action spectra for plant responses to UV irradiation. Generally, if the portion of an action spectrum measured longward of ∼300 nm spans less than about two orders in magnitude in its sensitivity, significant errors in the estimated RAF may ensue, and the use of this action spectrum in O3-related studies can be compromised.},

abstract={Solar erythemal irradiance (directly related to the UV index) has been measured in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the largest populated city of the country. Similar data have also been obtained at Marambio Argentine Antarctic Base inside and outside the ozone hole region. In the latter case, the largest UV index during the 1996-1999 period, of value 10.2, is 22% lower than the corresponding one for Buenos Aires. However near its maximum, the integrated daily dose, which is of importance in the evaluation of the accumulated dose along a given period, is rather similar in both places. We thus propose to use also this quantity for solar risk forecast at high latitudes. Ozone profile data for Buenos Aires and Marambio Base are presented, as well as time series of erythemal irradiance and ozone total column. Ozone profiles have been determined using the differential absorption lidar technique (DIAL) in Buenos Aires during periods near maximum and minimum of ozone total column and near the maximum of solar intensity. Model calculations of the erythemal irradiance are done, incorporating these profiles as well as those commonly used in this type of analysis. The influence of different atmospheric parameters as well as of the ground albedo on the erythemal irradiance has been tested.},

abstract={The t-J model on the square lattice, close to the t-Jz limit, is studied by quantum Monte Carlo techniques at finite temperature and in the underdoped regime. A variant of the Hoshen-Koppelman algorithm was implemented to identify the antiferromagnetic domains on each Trotter slice. The results show that the model at high enough temperature presents finite antiferromagnetic (AF) domains, which collapse at lower temperatures into a single ordered AF state. While there are domains, holes would tend to preferentially move along the domain walls. In this case, there are indications of hole pairing starting at a relatively high temperature. At lower temperatures, when the whole system becomes essentially fully AF ordered, at least in finite clusters, holes would likely tend to move within phase separated regions. The crossover between both states moves down in temperature as doping increases and/or as the off-diagonal exchange increases. The possibility of hole motion along AF domain walls at zero temperature in the fully isotropic t-J is discussed.},

abstract={Antibody adhesion kinetic in real time has been studied by laser reflectometry technique. An ellipsometer is used to measure the light intensity reflected by a silicon wafer. Light intensity reflected by the wafer presents a minimum at the pseudo-Brewster angle. Then, the reflectance increases as the antibodies (monoclonal anti-AB) adhere on interface. Mathematical analysis of reflectance curves versus time verifies that the antibody adhesion at the interface follows Langmuir kinetics (Prog. Biomed. Opt. Imaging 1(5) (2000) 19) for low antibody concentrations. Parameters obtained allow to carry out a detailed study of the antibody adsorption and the antigen-antibody interaction. This conduces to development of an optical immunosensor for detection and quantification of soluble antigens, and a novel method for commercial antiserum quality control. This technique does not require labeled antibodies, being also independent of cellular factors. Also, this technique is quicker and sensible than the conventional immunohematology methods. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We study the half-filled Hubbard chain including next-nearest- neighbor hopping t′. The model has three phases: one insulating phase with dominant spin-density-wave correlations at large distances (SDWI), another phase with dominant spin-dimer correlations or dimerized insulator (DI), and a third one in which long-distance correlations indicate singlet superconductivity (SS). The boundaries of the SDWI are accurately determined numerically through a crossing of excited energy levels equivalent to the jump in the spin Berry phase. The DI-SS boundary is studied using several indicators such as correlation exponent Kρ, Drude weight Dc, localization parameter zL, and charge gap Δc.},

abstract={Broadband data of solar total (300-3000 nm) and ultraviolet (UV) (295-385 nm) irradiances as far as spectrometric data measured near the Southern Hemisphere summer solstice at the high-altitude desertic plateau Puna of Atacama, Argentina, are presented. The simultaneous contributions of small solar zenith angle, high-altitude desertic intertropical region plus a cumulus cloud formation around the Sun's angular position in the sky produced extreme high intensities. In particular, several measured total irradiances in a time interval of about one-and-a half hours near noon were higher than the extraterrestrial solar constant corrected for the actual Earth-Sun distance on these days (1412 W/m2), reaching a maximum value of 1528 W/m2 at 12:09 (Argentina local time, i.e. UT-3 h) corresponding to a solar zenith angle of 16°. The highest UV irradiance measured was 69.5 W/m2 at 13:29 (θz=2.4°). Mean percentage increases due to cloud effect of 6% for UV and 12% for total solar irradiances were estimated with respect to the situation of no-clouds near Sun. The mean UV over total irradiances percentage ratio was also determined giving 4.7% at the moment of cloud enhancement and 5% outside it, which shows that the UV component was also increased, but to a lesser extent. So situations with cumulus cloud formation in this region in relation to its biological and material degradation impacts must be taken into consideration. Photographs showing the particular configuration of the Sun-cumulus cloud system obtained at moments of very high solar intensities are also presented. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={The combination of speckle pattern interferometry and temporal phase unwrapping allows the measurement of large-object dynamic displacements without the propagation of spatial unwrapping errors. For retrieving phase data for whole-object displacement, the temporal Fourier transform method is a commonly used approach. As the temporal Fourier transform method can be applied with or without introducing a temporal carrier in one of the beams in an interferometer, this paper presents a comparison of both phase measurement techniques. The analysis is performed using computer-simulated speckle interferograms, an approach that allows to know precisely the original phase distribution and also to evaluate the spatial rms phase error as a function of the phase change introduced between two consecutive speckle interferograms. The performance of the temporal Fourier transform method to process experimental data modulated by a temporal carrier is also illustrated using results obtained from the study of a metal plate subjected to thermal loading. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Each pulse can induce high temperatures in a short time (&lt;200 ns), followed by an also fast (∼10 μs) cooling down. The samples, ion nitrided and post-irradiated with pulsed plasmas showed important surface property improvements with respect to samples subjected only to ion nitriding. Those improvements consisted of an increase in the thickness of the hardened layer, and in a reduction of the micro-hardness gradient. These results show a complex surface layer structure that improves the support base for loads, reducing the probability of surface layer loosening. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

For overcast conditions, median transmittance percentages with respect to the clearsky situation of 81%, 44% and 36% at high, medium and low clouds respectively for erythemal irradiance, and 83%, 30% and 23% for total irradiance were determined, similar to results at mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Irradiance enhancement by broken cloud fields is more pronounced from 5 to 7 octas cloud coverage and can last even hours, with peak instantaneous values of 113% for erythemal and 133% for total irradiance, with respect to the very clean clearsky situation. In each case, the total irradiance is usually more attenuated and also more enhanced by clouds than the erythemal irradiance.},

Under these test conditions both steels show, after the first few cycles and for both types of tests, a pronounced cyclic softening up to failure. The softening during LCF tests described by a simple empirical relationship is dependent on temperature but independent of the total strain amplitude of the tests. From the analysis of the hysteresis loops and corroborated by electron microscopy observations it can be concluded that the cyclic softening is produced by the softening observed in the internal stress as a consequence of the evolution of the microstructure. During cycling, the martensitic lath structure with high dislocation density and carbides along the lath interfaces evolves to a softer dislocation subgrain structure. This conclusion could be correlated with transmission electron microscopy observations. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

As a consequence, the extended model provides a relationship between the void growth rate and the hydrostatic pressure allowing porosity evolution. The formulation is validated by comparison with the classical Gurson model formulated for rate-independent isotropic media and spherical voids.

abstract={Numerical simulations of ion induced electron emission from solids mostly use the first order Born approximation within the dielectric formalism to describe valence electron excitation. As a result, the yield of emitted electrons is found to scale with the square of the projectile charge QP in contrast to experimental findings obtained with carbon targets. Since similar deviations from QP 2 scaling were observed for the electronic stopping power, at least a part of this deviation must be related to primary ion-electron interaction, for which an alternative description needs to be developed. We thus present here a distorted wave approach for the modelling of primary interaction, which can be expected to give better results in view of its success in describing ion-atom collisions at large impact velocity. Keeping the same description of the electron transport through the target, we show that both the electron yield and the stopping power ratios (with respect to the same quantities for C6+), as a function of the projectile charge, are better reproduced by this alternative approach. We show that low energy electron excitation is responsible for the deviation from the QP 2 scaling. We also analyse the effect of the transport on the primary electrons. This distorted wave approach successfully explains the shape of the ratio of energy differential spectra for two different QP obtained in earlier experiment for Al and C. Furthermore, we predict a different behaviour of the forward and backward electron emission with respect to QP in qualitative agreement with experimental results.},

abstract={We calculated the integrated UVB and plant damage irradiances for Argentina, a country in the Southern Hemisphere spread over a large latitudinal range. The irradiances were calculated for clear sky days using the Madronich code for the average conditions of the months corresponding to the summer and winter solstices and the fall and spring equinoxes. Ozone, aerosol and ground albedo typical for each region and for each period of the year have been considered. A comparison was made of the behavior of these irradiances at the different locations. A more pronounced time dependence of the plant damage irradiance was obtained because of the fact that the corresponding spectrum is largely concentrated at a small wavelength of the UVB interval. We established a correlation between both irradiances, which can be approximated by a quadratic function. Because the plant damage irradiance is a quantity that is not directly measured by instruments, we showed the utility of the correlation by determining this biological effectiveness from the integrated UVB irradiance measured at the Astronomical Observatory of Rosario, Argentina, on clear sky days of the year 2001, as a characteristic example of the midlatitude near-sea level location of a highly productive agricultural region, which can be extended to other regions of the world. The plant damage results are relative ones (as is the case for the crythemal irradiance). So, they can be used to determine the maximum/minimum and asymmetry ratios, to study the influence of atmospheric variables and to make comparisons with other geographical locations.},

abstract={The effect of antiferromagnetic interchain coupling in alternating spin (1,1/2) chains is studied by means of spin wave (SW) theory and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Two limiting cases are investigated, the two-leg ladder and its two-dimensional (2D) generalization. For the 2D case, SW approximation predicts a smooth-dimensional crossover keeping the ground state ordered, whereas in the ladder case the DMRG results show a gapped ground state for any J(⊥)&gt;0. Furthermore, the behavior of the correlation functions closely resemble the uniform spin-12 ladder. However, for small J(⊥), the gap behaves quadratically as Δ∼0.6J⊥2. Similarly to uniform spin chains, it is conjectured an analogous spin gap behavior for an arbitrary number of mixed spin chains. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

A numerical method formulated on the basis of the fractal approximation for ordinary and fractionary Brownian motion1 is proposed to evaluate the viscoelastic behavior of mammalian erythrocyte membranes. The diffraction pattern, which is circular when the mammalian erythrocyte membranes are at test, becomes elliptical when the cells undergo shear stress. Photometric readings of light intensity variation along the major axis of the elliptical diffraction pattern are recorded during the creep and recovery process. These data series are used to calculate fractal rheological parameters of self-affine Brownian motion on the erythrocytes, averaged over several millions of cells. Three different parameters over the time dependent process could be obtained, which are: correlation coefficient &lt;C(t)&gt;, correlation integral, and K2-entropy, and very different results were obtained.},

abstract={Three types of steels with different Cr and Ni contents were ion nitrided by means of 100 Hz glow discharge in a N2-H2 gas mixture using a special reactor installed in the SAXS beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS), Campinas, Brazil. The studied materials were austenitic (AISI 304 and DIN WNr 1.4882) and ferritic (SAE HNV3) steels. The experimental setup allowed the study of the structural evolution in situ and in real time of steel surfaces during the ion nitriding process itself, using the X-ray diffraction technique. The use of a well-collimated and intense X-ray beam of the synchrotron radiation source allowed successive short exposure diffraction patterns to be taken. A very fast ion nitriding process was verified for the three studied steels. The measurements concerning the nitriding kinetics of both austenitic steels indicated the formation of an S phase. Nevertheless, while in the AISI 304 steel, the S phase was later replaced by a compound layer of Γy1-Fe4N, in the DIN WNr 1.4882 steel, the S phase remained until the end of the nitriding process. In both cases, CrN was formed during the process. Instead, in the ferritic SAE HNV3 steel, the S and CrN phases were not observed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The implementation of new methods for reliable and fast identification and classification of seeds is of major technical and economical importance in the agricultural industry. As in ocular inspection, the automatic classification of seeds should be based on knowledge of seed size, shape, color and texture. In this work, we assess the discriminating power of these characteristics for the unique identification of seeds of 57 weed species. Using the performance of a naïve Bayes classifier as selection criterion, we identified a nearly optimal set of 12 (six morphological + four color + two textural) seed characteristics to be used as classification parameters. We found that, as expected, size and shape characteristics have larger discriminating power than color and textural ones. However, all these features are required to reach an identification performance acceptable for practical applications. In spite of its simplicity, the naive Bayes classifier reveals itself surprisingly good for the identification of seed species. This might be due to the careful selection of the feature set, leading to nearly independent parameters as assumed by this method. We also found that, using the same feature set, a more sophisticated classifier based on an artificial neural network committee performs only slightly better than this simple Bayesian approach. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Moreover, we show that the antiphase domain ordering occurs at a much lower temperature than the formation of charge inhomogeneities and charge localization. Hole-hole correlations indicate a metallic behavior of the stripes with no signs of hole attraction. Kinetic energies and current susceptibilities are computed and indications of charge localization are discussed. The study of the doping dependence in the range 0.083≤x≤0.167 suggests that these features are characteristic of the whole underdoped region.},

abstract={First-principles calculations for KH 2 PO 4 (KDP) show that hydrogen off-center (OC) ordering in the ferroelectric phase is accompanied by electronic charge delocalization from the acceptor and localization at the donor oxygen within the O-HO bonds. This induces P atoms off-centering in the PO 4 tetrahedrons and pairing with K + ions along the tetragonal axis, thus developing macroscopic polarization. Centered H are collectivelly unstable. However, if the protons are centered, the P and K atoms are stable in their centered positions. In addition, off-centering of a single proton is not energetically favorable. Only correlated proton motions, involving also displacements of heavier atoms, exhibit significant double wells, thus questioning the role of tunneling in isotope effects. © 2002 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={The Fourier transform method has become a popular technique to retrieve the phase map encoded by Digital Speckle Pattern Interferometry (DSPI) fringes. When closed fringes need to be analyzed, carder fringes must be introduced in the pattern to eliminate the sign ambiguity that appears in the phase distribution. Recently, a method based on the application of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) has been reported to evaluate phase maps in SPI. The CWT method does not produce ambiguities in the phase sign even when carder fringes are not introduced in the interferometer. In the present paper the performance of the CWT phase-extraction method is evaluated using computer-simulated fringes, approach that allows knowing precisely the phase map contained in the pattern. It is shown that only DSPI fringes that verify the stationary phase approximation and its analytic asymptotic limit can be processed with this method. The influence of the filtering process to smooth the DSPI fringes and of the method used to extend the fringe pattern edges is also analyzed. Additional drawbacks that emerge when this method is applied are finally discussed.},

This conclusion is supported by the residual Bouguer anomaly map and by the total magnetic map reduced to the pole, as well as by refraction and reflection seismic data and earthquake focal mechanisms. We put forward a gravity model that explains the structural history of these two basins. The model proposes that an originally single foreland basin was divided into two basins by strike slip along the Desaguadero-Bermejo fault. The eastern portion of this original basin moved northward, uplifted, and rotated clockwise. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The triple differential cross section (3DCS) for the (e,2e) ionization of diatomic hydrogen is determined using the first-order transition matrix element of the Born series. A two-effective center continuum wave function which takes into account the diatomic character of the target is introduced to describe the ejected electron in the exit channel. Vertical transitions from the equilibrium position of the 1Σg + ground electronic state of the target to the 2Σg + ground electronic state of the residual H2 + are considered for relatively high incident electron energy values (∼4 keV). This approach, which needs relatively small computational efforts to apply it to other diatomic systems, produces results that are in good agreement with existing experimental data. The influence on 3DCS of the screening of the nuclear charges produced by the residual bound electron in the exit channel is studied. ©2001 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Positronium formation through electron capture from ground-state closed-shell sodium clusters is studied theoretically at intermediate impact energies. The charge transfer process is described in the independent electron model by a continuum distorted-wave approximation. In this approximation, distortions in the final state are introduced by using two Coulomb wavefunctions associated with the positron- and electron-residual target interactions. The cluster is described within the framework of the spherical background jellium model and the Kohn-Sham formalism with a local-density approximation that includes exchange, correlation, and a self-interaction correction. Using a partial-wave technique, differential and total cross sections for the isoelectronic neutral and charged closed-shell sodium clusters Na20, Na19- and Na21+ are computed and compared with the predictions of the Coulomb-Born type approximation which neglects the distortions in the final state.},

For both models, the inclusion of one-loop corrections to saddle-point results leads to the prediction of nonmagnetic phases for particular values of the parameters J1/J2 and J′1/J1. In the case of the J1 - J2 model we shed light on the existence of such a disordered quantum state, a question which is controversial in the literature.

By contrast, the polarization in the modulation direction is continuous through the interfaces with the interior of the KTaO3 layers remaining polarized for modulation lengths of up to 160 unit cells. The zero-frequency dielectric constant in the modulation direction has a similar magnitude to that of KNbO3. An investigation of the switching behavior shows that for modulation lengths greater than 24 unit cells, each KNbO3 layer behaves essentially independently. For modulation lengths of less than 12 unit cells, the KNbO3 layers interact so strongly with each other that the superlattice essentially behaves as a single artificial structure. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

Electrostatic forces, then, push the K+ ions towards off-centre positions, and induce a macroscopic polarization. The analysis of the correlation between different geometrical and electronic quantities, in connection with experimental data, supports the idea that the role of tunnelling in isotopic effects is irrelevant. Instead, geometrical quantum effects appear to play a central role. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Simulating the forming of anisotropic polycrystals, such as zirconium, requires a description of the anisotropy of the aggregate and the single crystal, and also of their evolution with deformation (texture development and hardening). Introducing the anisotropy of the single crystal requires the use of polycrystal models that account for inhomogeneous deformation depending on grain orientation. In particular, visco-plastic self-consistent models have been successfully used for describing strongly anisotropic aggregates. As a consequence, using a polycrystal constitutive law inside finite element (FE) codes represents a considerable improvement over using empirical constitutive laws, since the former provides a physically based description of anisotropy and its evolution. In this work we develop a polycrystal constitutive description for pure Zr deforming under quasi-static conditions at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures. We use tensile and compressive experimental data obtained from a clock-rolled Zr sheet to adjust the constitutive parameters of the polycrystal model. Twinning is accounted for in the description. The polycrystal model is implemented into an explicit FE code, assuming a full polycrystal at the position of each integration point. The orientation and hardening of the individual grains associated with each element is updated as deformation proceeds. We report preliminary results of this methodology applied to simulate the three-dimensional deformation of zirconium bars deforming under four-point bend conditions to maximum strains of about 20%. A critical comparison between experiments and predictions is done in a second paper (Kaschner et al., Acta mater. 2001, 49(15), 3097-3107).},

abstract={When mechanical vibrations are measured by means of a dynamic phase-shifting speckle pattern interferometer, the deformation can be tracked with an error that depends on the amplitude and frequency of the vibration. We use a numerical simulation based on a detailed mathematical model of the system to predict the expected frequency response of the root mean square (rms) measurement error in the time-varying phase difference maps. The performance of four phase-shifting algorithms (three-frame, four-frame, Carré, and Schwider-Hariharan five-frame) and a temporal phase unwrapping method is studied over a range of vibrational amplitudes and frequencies. The numerical results indicate that the Carré algorithm is the preferred phase-shifting method to measure vibrations with a dynamic electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) system. Vibration frequencies up to 30% of the carrier frequency can be measured with an rms phase change error less than 10% of the vibration amplitude. The numerical results are finally compared with experimental data, acquired using a 1000 frame/s phase-shifting speckle interferometer together with a laser vibrometer, which provides a reference phase measure. © 2001 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

We show that small displacements of the anion can stabilize new mixed charged-density wave-bond order wave phases in which central symmetry centers are suppressed. This finding is discussed in the context of recent experiments. We suggest that the recently observed charge ordering is due to a cooperative effect between the Coulomb interaction and the coupling of the electronic stacks to the anions.

Through MC simulations, a full picture of these complex processes is obtained. Co quickly diffuses through the Pb monolayer exchanging place with Cu atoms at the substrate. The exchange process diffusion inhibits the formation of pure Co islands, reducing the surface stress and then the formation of multilayer islands and the pools of vacancies. On the other hand, the random exchange also suppress the nucleation preferential sites generated by Co atoms at Cu steps, responsible of the step decoration.},

abstract={Three polycrystalline samples of Zr702α are deformed at room temperature under channel die compression until about 40% strain. Samples are oriented differently in the die with respect to their texture, so that the influence of the initial texture on the stress-strain response, the activated deformation systems, and the subsequent texture evolution can be assessed. Experimental results are interpreted by using a viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) polycrystalline model in which a saturating anisotropic intracrystalline hardening law is introduced. It is shown that the orientation dependence of the activated slip systems strongly depends on the texture of the polycrystal. The main effect of intracrystalline hardening is found to be a redistribution of slip from the primary to the secondary systems, but in a moderate way such that it does not affect significantly the development of texture. A simple analysis shows that the increasing activity of the secondary slip systems can be assessed directly from the macroscopic stress-strain curves. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Ensembles of artificial neural networks have been used in the last years as classification/regression machines, showing improved generalization capabilities that outperform those of single networks. However, it has been recognized that for aggregation to be effective the individual networks must be as accurate and diverse as possible. An important problem is, then, how to tune the aggregate members in order to have an optimal compromise between these two conflicting conditions. We propose here a simple method for constructing regression/classification ensembles of neural networks that leads to overtrained aggregate members with an adequate balance between accuracy and diversity. The algorithm is favorably tested against other methods recently proposed in the literature, producing an improvement in performance on the standard statistical databases used as benchmarks. In addition, and as a concrete application, we apply our method to the sunspot time series and predict the remainder of the current cycle 23 of solar activity.},

The simulation is based on a detailed mathematical model of the system, which is used to predict the expected frequency response of the rms measurement error, in the time-varying phase difference maps, as a result of vibration. The performance of different phase-shifting algorithms is studied over a range of vibrational frequencies. Phase-difference evaluation is performed by means of temporal phase shifting and temporal phase unwrapping. It is demonstrated that longer sampling windows and higher framing rates are preferred in order to reduce the phase-change error that is due to vibration. A numerical criterion for an upper limit on the length of time window for the phase-shifting algorithm is also proposed. The numerical results are finally compared with experimental data, acquired with a phase-shifting speckle interferometer of 1000 frames/s. © 2001 Optical Society of America.},

In addition, we suggest that the intensity of this peak and the spin-spin correlation at the maximum distance along the ladder direction remain finite in the bulk limit for strong enough interladder coupling.

However, the consideration of Gaussian fluctuation of order parameters around these mean-field solutions produces unstable modes in the dynamical matrix for all relevant parameter values, leaving only reduced stability regions for the Néel phase. We have computed the one-loop corrections to the energy in these regions, and have also briefly considered the effects of the correlated hopping term that is obtained in the reduction from the Hubbard to the t-J model. ©2000 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={A series of experiments and simulations that vary the texture and microstructure simultaneously are used to establish the role of the microstructure in texture formation in FCC metals. The stacking fault energy (SFE) of the metal, which is known to have a strong impact on texture and microstructure, is the vital parameter used to make these variations. It was determined that the wide variety of textures and microstructures observed as a function of SFE and temperature was developed by slip processes alone; twinning was not necessary, as previously thought. The different textures are caused by (i) variations in local slip patterns within a single grain, as revealed by grain subdivision into differently deforming cell blocks; and (ii) more subtly by the cell-block shape. The local selection of slip systems creating the lattice rotations within a cell block is altered by the planarity of slip. Slip planarity is controlled by the SFE and temperature. It is hypothesized that the new texture components, that are distinct from the generally accepted ideal components, are created by the different slip processes occurring as a result of low SFE and low temperature. A more subtle effect of grain subdivision is related to the cell-block shapes that develop as a function of SFE and temperature and correspond to the different textures observed. The shape of the cell block is related to the level of constraint required by the deformation. The slip pattern changes and cell-block shapes correlate with the presence or absence of certain ideal texture components whose evolution is not simulated. Materials and conditions with similar deformation microstructures developed similar textures in the experiments. © 2000 The Royal Society.},

Despite the very well known effect of strengthening of textures in some soft materials, that behavior is usually not well understood either regarded as a very common behavior. Furthermore, the emergency of some additional texture components has not been investigated either addressed beyond considering them spurious components not worthy of a more detailed search [1-4]. The fact that some textures weaken, some become stronger and some develop extra components can give extraordinary insights in the prevailing deformation mechanisms in poly-phase materials. In the current paper we discuss the mechanisms of strain and sp.n sharing between both phases in a wire drawn Cu-Fe powder composite. We will show that very carefully obtained experimental results are able to show some unsteady components at different deformation steps.

The basement blocks of the Sierras Pampeanas are bounded by longitudinal faults that originated during or were reactivated by the Andean Orogeny, then uplifted by reverse faults during the late Tertiary and the Quaternary. Utilizing primarily gravity data, interpreted with the aid of geological information and seismological and seismic data, we developed models consistent with: (1) seismic data on the Moho, and (2) a significant regional gradient of 'g' from west to east. In order to be consistent with (1), we took into account the gravimetric effects of the subhorizontal Nazca plate, whereas to be consistent with (2), it was necessary to wedge the Bermejo Basin sediments under very dense positive masses within the upper crust underlying the Sierra de Valle Fertil. Two crustal models were developed by inversion of the Bouguer anomaly. These fully fit the Bouguer anomaly and the geological data and reveal two zones of high density that are interpreted as paleosutures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We consider a modified extended Hubbard model (EHM) which, in addition to the on-site repulsion U and nearest-neighbor repulsion V, includes polarization effects in second-order perturbation theory. The model is equivalent to an EHM with renormalized U plus a next-nearest-neighbor repulsion term. Using a method based on topological quantum numbers (charge and spin Berry phases), we generalize to finite hopping t the quantum phase diagram in one dimension constructed by van den Brink et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 4658 (1995)]. At hopping t=0 there are two charge density-wave phases, one spin density-wave phase, and one intermediate phase with charge and spin ordering, depending on the parameter values. At t≠0 the nature of each phase is confirmed by studying correlation functions. However, in addition to the strong-coupling phases, a small region with bond ordering appears. The region occupied by the intermediate phase first increases and then decreases with increasing t, until it finally disappears for t of the order but larger than U. For small t, the topological transitions agree with the results of second-order perturbation theory.},

abstract={The separation of regional and residual potential field anomalies, regarded as a spectral problem, can be greatly facilitated when a spectrum estimate shows a clear break between low- and high-frequency components, a feature that normal fast-Fourier-transform (FFT) methods fail to present. In this work, we model the discrete Fourier transform of a potential field, measured at stations irregularly distributed on a surface, by means of a high-resolution sparse estimate derived originally for seismic signal processing. The coefficients of this estimate, which are distributed according to the Cauchy probability law, produce a model with only few components having a significant value. A steepest-descent algorithm gives a computing alternative to large matrix multiplications and inversions. Advantages of taking this approach are twofold. First, the high-resolution transform can be used as a gridding tool to evaluate the potential field either on a horizontal plane or on the topographic surface. The enhancement of the spectral peaks and the virtual absence of side-lobes prevents oscillations and edge effects in the result. Secondly, the sparse distribution of the spectral elements allows the interpreter to locate clearly the low-frequency components related to the regional field. After a second and faster pass, the values of those coefficients can be redefined in order to obtain a more robust separation, adjusting the residuals by the Cauchy criterion. A theoretical noise-free example to separate the magnetic anomaly of a prism from a polynomial background illustrates well the difference between sparse and FFT spectra. An example with real Bouguer anomalies in the Interserrana basin, Argentina, shows that gridding results, in this case reduced to sea level, compare well with those obtained by other gridding methods, and that the separation procedure is able to outline well defined areas of positive and negative residual anomalies.

We find that the main role of the surfactant is to hinder fast diffusion by hopping over the surface, which is the dominant mechanism on a compact face such as Cu(111), and to promote exchange. As a side effect, this facilitates interlayer diffusion and hence layer-by-layer growth, because islands are smaller and have rougher borders; adatoms reaching an edge have more opportunities to cross them by exchange with a step atom.},

Even if single adsorhate atoms diffuse by hopping on the substrate surface and do not mix at the terraces, two-dimensional islands formed by nucleation may become unstable above a certain critical size and explode upwards forming clusters of several atomic layers. This process is accompanied by strong distortions of the underlying atomic layers, and on soft materials it can result in surface etching and incorporation of substrate atoms into the islands.},

This law is shown to be exact for the first-order Born approximation when M T ≫ 1 (with M T the target mass) independently of the kinematical conditions considered. For high enough target nuclear charges, the scaling is proven to be valid in a Coulomb-Born approximation (CBA) in which correct boundary conditions are included in the initial wavefunction. The scaling formula is also studied for an extension with correct initial boundary conditions of the model introduced by Brauner, Briggs and Klar (BBK) in which an approximation to the exact final wavefunction is made, taking into account properly the asymptotic Coulombic character of the interactions between the aggregates of the collision system. In this case, the validity of the scaling is shown for a coplanar asymmetric geometry. At high enough impact energies, the scaling law works well for smaller target nuclear charges when the CBA and the BBK theoretical descriptions are used.},

A larger measuring range is obtained by dividing the desired maximum-phase range into several subranges where the spatial synchronous detection method can be successfully applied. These phase subranges correspond to small out-of-plane displacements of the object, and a speckle pattern is recorded for each displacement. The carrier fringes are obtained by the subtraction correlation of two consecutive speckle fields with a translation of the illuminating beam between recordings. The method allows the measurement of object displacements of about 216 μm.},

The measurements were done by the Reverse Time of Flight (RTOF) neutron diffraction technique. The position and width of diffraction peaks were fitted by local Fourier expansions until the relative errors were less than 0.01%. Five different volume fractions of both phases (100%Al, 75%Al-25%Mg, 50%Al-50%Mg, 25%Al-75%Mg and 100%Mg) were measured at Von Mises equivalent strain of 2.8. The results are described and the correlation between volume fraction of both phases, measured residual strains, textures and mechanical properties of both phases are studied. It is found that the high plastic anisotropy of Mg induces residual strains even in the case of pure Mg. The Al strains show anisotropic behavior only at low Al content, when the Mg is able to transfer its own high anisotropy to the Al. The residual strains are computed by using a visco-plastic selfconsistent model extended to take in account the hydrostatic pressures in such way that the stresses and residual strains are reckoned after the deformation process is halted and the sample unloaded. The results come out in close agreement with the experimental values and they can give hints about microscopical behaviors as well as experimental improvements.},

abstract={Highly anisotropic and inhomogeneously deforming materials, like two-phase materials, show the characteristic of enhancing those behaviors. By extrapolation to less anisotropic materials and more homogeneous deformation processes a lot can be learnt from them. Studying those materials is not only basically important but also for the understanding of the deformation process of many technological alloys. In the current paper extrusion deformation textures of Al-Mg powder composites, measured by neutron diffraction, are informed. The results are explained in terms of active slip systems, strain and spin sharing. 1-Site and 2-Sites Self-Consistent simulations were performed to get insights in the way both phases share strains and spins. The simulated Orientation Distribution Functions (ODF) came out very consistent with the experimental values. Degrees of strain sharing and number and type of slip systems result from the simulation.},

abstract={Interatomic potentials are determined in the framework of a shell model used to simulate the structural instabilities, dynamical properties, and phase transition sequence of BaTiO3. The model is developed from first-principles calculations by mapping the potential energy surface for various ferroelectric distortions. The parameters are obtained by performing a fit of interatomic potentials to this energy surface. Several zero-temperature properties of BaTiO3, which are of central importance, are correctly simulated in the framework of our model. The phase diagram as a function of temperature is obtained through constant-pressure molecular dynamics simulations, showing that the non-trivial phase transition sequence of BaTiO3 is correctly reproduced. The lattice parameters and expansion coefficients for the different phases are in good agreement with experimental data, while the theoretically determined transition temperatures tend to be too small. © 1999 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The motivations for the study of these systems range from general theoretical questions concerning frustrated quantum spin models to the concrete description of the insulating phase of some layered molecular crystals. For both models, the inclusion of one-loop corrections to saddle-point results leads to the prediction of nonmagnetic phases for particular values of the parameters J1/J2 and J1′/J1. In the case of the J1-J2 model we shed light on the existence of such disordered quantum state, a question which is controversial in the literature. For the J1-J1′ model our results for the ground-state energy, quantum renormalization of the pitch in the spiral phase, and the location of the nonmagnetic phases, nicely agree with series expansions predictions. ©1999 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={A real gravimetric surveys were carried out in the Ischigualasto-Villa Union intermontane deep basin, the north of the Andean Precordillera, and in a wide portion of the western Sierras Pampeanas. Maps of Bouguer anomalies (AB) and Bouguer anomalies 'affected by geological reduction' (ABcg) were derived from the observed data. The basin is located in a complex tectonic setting that strongly contaminates the gravity field. The present study aims to interpret the 3D geometry of the sedimentary basin through gravity data analysis. The separation of the gravimetric effect of the sedimentary filling is a complex task presently solved by employing: i- a graphical smoothing method from AB; and ii- numerical filterings from ABcg (AB corrected by the sedimentary filling effect of neighboring basins). This analysis permits to deduce that in the center and north of the basin the gravity anomalies should be mainly the result of the sedimentary filling effect, whereas in the south of the basin positive effects in the crust prevail due most likely to mafic intrusive rocks. A gravity model supported by seismic data that provides sedimentary thicknesses of up to 9 km in the central region of the basin was formulated by using gravimetric inversion of the residual anomaly.},

Different inclusion aspect ratios are studied in the elastic and incipient elastoplastic regime for a model SiC-Al composite. The solution of the field equations is obtained via an explicit algorithm that yields the interaction field in terms of the stress and strain variables. The particles and fibers are taken as purely elastic, and the matrix is regarded as elastic-perfectly plastic. Coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) are calculated both under the assumption of purely elastic response and at the onset of plastic localized deformation. The simulated stress-strain curves show the influence of interaction stresses on macroscopic yield stress for different inclusion aspect ratios, with no consideration of matrix hardening. The model allows a good simulation of the thermomechanical behavior of composite materials and contributes to the understanding of the elastoplastic transition in stress-strain curves. It can also simply explain some of the most distinctive features of the mechanical behavior of composites. The model presents the possibility of controlling many input variables and geometries and simultaneously considering three-dimensional deformation of interacting inclusion-reinforced materials with low computational effort. Comparisons to experimental CTE and residual stresses are provided.},

abstract={Conformal and conformal avoidance radiation therapy are new therapeutic techniques that are generally characterized by high dose gradients. The success of this kind of treatment relies on quality assurance procedures in order to verify the delivery of the treatment. A delivery verification technique should consider quality assurance procedures for patient positioning and radiation delivery verification. A methodology for radiation delivery verification was developed and tested with our tomotherapy workbench. The procedure was investigated for two cases. The first treatment using a torus-shaped target was optimized for 72 beam directions and sequentially delivered as a single slice to a 33 cm diameter cylinder of homogeneous solid water. For the second treatment, a random pattern of energy fluence was helically delivered for two slices to a 9.0 cm diameter phantom containing inhomogeneities. The presented process provides the energy fluence (or a related quantity) delivered through the multileaf collimator (MLC) using the signal measured at the exit detector during the treatment delivery. As this information is created for every pulse of the accelerator, the energy fluence and state for each MLC leaf were verified on a pulse-by-pulse basis. The pulse-by-pulse results were averaged to obtain projection-by-projection information to allow for a comparison with the planned delivery. The errors between the planned and delivered energy fluences were concentrated between ±2.0%, with none beyond +3.5%. In addition to accurately achieving radiation delivery verification, the process is fast, which could translate to radiation delivery verification in real time. This technique can also be extended to reconstruct the dose actually deposited in the patient or phantom (dose reconstruction).},

abstract={A system to improve winter horticultural cultivation inside greenhouses has been developed in the central part of Argentina. Previous investigators showed that it is possible to avoid the harmful freezing effects using a combination of thermal curtains and heating tubes in which warm water from a geothermal source flows. However, in spite of these improvements, during many winter nights the ambient temperature tends to remain low inside the greenhouses, causing plant growth detention. The objective of the current work is to prevent plant growth detention by concentrating, as near the plants as possible, the energy stored in the soil during daytime and delivered by the tubes at night. This was achieved by adding a transparent and light synthetic thermal blanket to the previous improvements in order to decrease convective heat transfer effects. The results were evaluated measuring temperatures at different places of the prototype. Prototype data of winter nights were plotted and compared with temperatures from the effective greenhouse that includes thermal blankets. The system maintained satisfactory temperature levels in the surroundings of the plants, allowing their continuous growth. The raw materials necessary for these improvements are cheap common market materials, the arrangement of the whole system does not take more than a few hours, and the operation of the system is simple and not time consuming. The system with thermal blankets maintained temperatures of over 13°C most of the winter nights, which is necessary for the continuous growth and fructification of tomatoes and peppers. © Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract={High-temperature processing induces large internal stresses at room temperature in composites because of the difference between the thermal coefficients of the matrix and of the reinforcing particles. In this work we develop a theoretical scheme to calculate the strains in the particles by using the Eshelby equivalent method. The interaction between the inhomogeneous inclusions (fibres) is evaluated by means of a mean-field model given by Mori and Tanaka, and full anisotropy of fibres and matrix is taken into account within an explicit approach by which the problem is solved as a function of the deformation field instead of the thermoelastic properties. The model is applied to the thermoelastic moduli and residual stresses in biphase composites. We analyse the influence of the orientation distribution function of fibres, its volume fraction and elastic inhomogeneity factor on Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and the thermal coefficients. We calculate the thermal residual stresses in an Al2O3-SiC composite as a function of direction, and the results are compared with the neutron measurements made by Majundar et al. As the non-uniform crystal structure of SiC whiskers complicates the interpretation of experimental data collected from whisker-reinforced composites, a general equation based on the fractions of cubic and hexagonal polytypes is incorporated in the model. We demonstrate that the residual stresses cannot easily be explained on the basis of elastic interactions and distribution of fibre orientations, even accounting for the elastic and thermal anisotropy of fibres. Correct interpretation and comparison of residual stresses with the measured values requires analysis of the peak shift and broadening stemming from the residual stresses.},

abstract={A real gravimetric surveys were carried out in the Ischigualasto-Villa Unión intermontane deep basin, the north of the Andean Precordillera, and in a wide portion of the western Sierras Pampeanas. Maps of Bonguer anomalies (AB) and Bouguer anomalies "affected by geological reduction" (ABcg) were derived from the observed data. The basin is located in a complex tectonic setting that strongly contaminates the gravity field. The present study aims to interpret the 3D geometry of the sedimentary basin through gravity data analysis. The separation of the gravimetric effect of the sedimentary filling is a complex task presently solved by employing: i- a graphical smoothing method from AB; and ii- numerical filterings from ABcg (AB corrected by the sedimentary filling effect of neighboring basins). This analysis permits to deduce that in the center and north of the basin the gravity anomalies should be mainly the result of the sedimentary filling effect, whereas in the south of the basin positive effects in the crust prevail due most likely to mafic intrusive rocks. A gravity model supported by seismic data that provides sedimentary thicknesses of up to 9 km in the central region of the basin was formulated by using gravimetric inversion of the residual anomaly.},

abstract={In the present work we focus our interest on the electron capture process from H2 + by proton impact at high impact energies. The molecular-continuum distorted wave (M-CDW) and the corresponding two effective center (TEC-CDW) approximations are used to compute single differential (as a function of the molecular alignment) and total electron capture cross sections. In the M-CDW approximation the field created by both nuclei of the target is considered to act simultaneously on the electron in the exit channel. On the contrary, in the TEC-CDW approximation each one of these nuclei is considered to affect separately the captured electron. Then, the importance of the effects due to this multicenter character of molecular aggregates in the charge transfer process is studied through the comparison of theoretical cross sections obtained with both approximations for the H++H2 + system. It is found that multicenter effects are important for the study of differential cross sections as a function of the molecular orientation but they do not modify significantly the total cross sections. The origin of this behavior is interpreted in terms of the impact parameter dependence of the capture probability. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Several experiments in the context of ladder materials have recently shown that the study of simple models of anisotropic ladders (i.e. with different couplings along legs and rungs) is important for the understanding of these compounds. In this paper Exact Diagonalization studies of the one-band Hubbard and t - J models are reported for a variety of densities, couplings, and anisotropy ratios. The emphasis is given to the one-particle spectral function A(q, ω) which presents a flat quasiparticle dispersion at the chemical potential in some region of parameter space. This is correlated with the existence of strong pairing fluctuations, which themselves are correlated with an enhancement of the bulk-extrapolated value for the two-hole binding energy as well as with the strength of the spin-gap in the hole-doped system. Part of the results for the spectral function are explained using a simple analytical picture valid when the hopping along the legs is small. In particular, this picture predicts an insulating state at quarter filling in agreement with the metal-insulator transition observed at this special filling for increasing rung couplings. The results are compared against previous literature, and in addition pair-pair correlations using extended operators are also here reported.},

abstract={Inasmuch as current fringe analysis techniques used in digital speckle-pattern interferometry (DSPI) yield a phase map modulo 2π, phase unwrapping is the final step of any data evaluation process. The performance of a recently published algorithm used to unwrap DSPI phase maps is investigated. The algorithm is based on a least-squares minimization technique that is solvable by the discrete cosine transform. When phase inconsistencies are present, they are handled by exclusion of invalid pixels from the unwrapping process through the assignment of zero-valued weights. Then the weighted unwrapping problem is solved in an iterative manner by a preconditioned conjugate-gradient method. The evaluation is carried out with computer-simulated DSPI phase maps, an approach that permits the generation of phase fields without inconsistencies, which are then used to calculate phase deviations as a function of the iteration number. Real data are also used to illustrate the performance of the algorithm. © 1998 Optical Society of America.},

abstract={Tomotherapy is a dose delivery technique using helical or axial intensity modulated beams. One of the strengths of the tomotherapy concept is that it can incorporate a number of processes into a single piece of equipment. These processes include treatment optimization planning, dose reconstruction and kilovoltage/megavoltage image reconstruction. A common computational technique that could be used for all of these processes would be very appealing. The maximum likelihood estimator, originally developed for emission tomography, can serve as a useful tool in imaging and radiotherapy. We believe that this approach can play an important role in the processes of optimization planning, dose reconstruction and kilovoltage and/or megavoltage image reconstruction. These processes involve computations that require comparable physical methods. They are also based on equivalent assumptions, and they have similar mathematical solutions. As a result, the maximum likelihood approach is able to provide a common framework for all three of these computational problems. We will demonstrate how maximum likelihood methods can be applied to optimization planning, dose reconstruction and megavoltage image reconstruction in tomotherapy. Results for planning optimization, dose reconstruction and megavoltage image reconstruction will be presented. Strengths and weaknesses of the methodology are analysed.

abstract={A method is proposed to improve the accuracy of approximate techniques for strongly correlated electrons that use reduced Hilbert spaces. As a first step, the method involves a change of basis that incorporates exactly part of the short-distance interactions. The Hamiltonian is rewritten in new variables that better represent the physics of the problem under study. A Hilbert-space expansion performed in the new basis follows. The method is successfully tested using both the Heisenberg model and the t-J model with holes on two-leg ladders and chains, including estimations for ground-state energies, static correlations, and spectra of excited states. An important feature of this technique is its ability to calculate dynamical responses on clusters larger than those that can be studied using exact diagonalization. The method is applied to the analysis of the dynamical spin structure factor 5(q,ω) on clusters with 2 × 16 sites and 0 and 2 holes. Our results confirm previous studies [M. Troyer, H. Tsunetsugu, and T. M. Rice, Phys. Rev. B 53, 251 (1996)] that suggested that the state of the lowest energy in the spin-1 2-hole subspace corresponds to the bound state of a hole pair and a spin triplet. Implications of this result for neutron-scattering experiments both on ladders and planes are discussed.},

The filter, derived from information theory and statistical mechanics considerations, is an iterative, adaptive, and clustering algorithm that performs edge-preserving smoothing. To apply the filter, the kernel size and the number of iterations must be previously set. We show that both parameters can be chosen depending on image features, e.g., presence or absence of sharp edges due to shadows, holes, or physical limits of the test object. When high-contrast edges are present, it is also shown that better noise reduction and edge preservation are obtained when the convergence of the solution of the filter is truncated. Both computer-simulated and experimental correlation fringes are used to test the Scale-Space filter. © 1998 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

The complete stress state in the grains is obtained by computing the deviatoric and the hydrostatic local deviations with respect to the overall corresponding magnitudes applied to the polycrystal. The extended VPSC model, followed by an elastic self-consistent unloading, is used to obtain the intergranular residual strains in the aggregate after large plastic deformation. The texture evolution and the hardening of the material are explicitly taken into account in the model. As an application, the model is used to predict intergranular residual states in Incoloy-800 plate after uniaxial deformation.},

abstract={Spin models that have been proposed to describe dimerized chains, ladders, two-dimensional antiferromagnets. and other compounds are studied here when some spins are replaced by spinless vacancies, such as it occurs by Zn doping. A small percentage of vacancies rapidly destroys the spin gap, and their presence induces enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations near those vacancies. The study is performed with computational techniques which includes Lanczos, world-line Monte Carlo, and the density-matrix renormalization-group methods. Since the phenomenon of enhanced antiferromagnetism is found to occur in several models and cluster geometries, a common simple explanation for its presence may exist. It is argued that the resonating-valence-bond character of the spin correlations at short distances of a large variety of models is responsible for the presence of robust staggered spin correlations near vacancies and lattice edges. The phenomenon takes place regardless of the long distance properties of the ground state, and it is caused by a "pruning" of the available spin singlets in the vicinity of the vacancies. The effect produces a broadening of the low-temperature NMR signal for the compounds analyzed here. This broadening should be experimentally observable in the structurally dimerized chain systems Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O, CuWO4, (VO)2P2O7, and Sr14Cu24O41, in ladder materials such as SrCu2O3, in the spin-Peierls systems CuGeO3 and NaV2O5, and in several others since it is a universal effect common to a wide variety of models and compounds. In addition, it is argued that the Néel order observed in SrCu2O3 upon Zn doping is induced by the local antiferromagnetic order discussed in this paper, enhanced by a favorable ratio between the actual Heisenberg couplings along chains and rungs, as reported in recent experimental literature. Based on this reasoning it is predicted here that other ladder materials such as Zn-doped Cu2(C5H12N2)2Cl 4 will not present Néel order at small Zn concentrations.},

abstract={The problem of two holes in the presence of strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations is revisited using computational techniques. Two-dimensional clusters and two-leg ladders are studied with the Lanczos and truncated Lanczos algorithms. Lattices with up to 2 × 16 and √32× √32 sites are studied. The motivation of the paper is the recently discussed spatial distribution of holes in ladders where the maximum probability for the hole-hole distance is obtained at d = √2 in units of the lattice spacing, a counterintuitive result considering that the overall symmetry of the two-hole bound state is dx2-y2. Here this effect is shown to appear in small ladder clusters that can be addressed exactly, and also in planes. The probability distribution of hole distances d was found to be broad with several distances contributing appreciably to the wave function. The existence of holes in the same sublattice is argued to be a consequence of non-negligible retardation effects in the t-J model. Effective models with instantaneous interactions nevertheless capture the essence of the hole pairing process in the presence of short-range antiferromagnetic fluctuations (especially regarding the symmetry properties of the condensate), similarly as the (nonretarded) BCS model contains the basic features of the more complicated electron-phonon problem in low-temperature superconductors. The existence of strong spin singlets in the region where the two-hole bound state is located is here confirmed, and a simple explanation for its origin in the case of planes is proposed using the Néel state as a background, complementing previous explanations based on a spin-liquid undoped state. It is predicted that these strong singlets should appear regardless of the long distance properties of the spin system under consideration, as long as the bound state is dx2-y2. In particular, it is shown that they are present in an Ising spin background. The time retardation in the family of t-J models leads naturally to low-energy hole states with nonzero momentum and spin one, providing a possible explanation for apparent SO(5)-symmetric features observed recently in this context. Finally, the influence of a short-range Coulombic repulsion is analyzed. Rough estimations suggest that at a distance of one lattice spacing this repulsion is larger than the exchange J. The hole distribution in the dx2-y2 bound state is reanalyzed in the presence of such repulsion. Very short hole-hole distances lose their relevance in the presence of a realistic hole-hole interaction.},

For the triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet we found that the corrections weaken the stiffness, but the ground state of the system remains ordered in the classical 120° spiral pattern. In the case of the J1-J2 model, with increasing frustration the stiffness is reduced until it vanishes, leaving a small window 0.53≲ η≲0.64 where the system has no long-range magnetic order. In addition, we discuss several methodological questions related to the Schwinger-boson approach. In particular, we show that the consideration of finite clusters which require twisted boundary conditions to fit the infinite-lattice magnetic order avoids the use of ad hoc factors to correct the Schwinger-boson predictions.},

Using these distorted wave approximations, total cross sections for H+ and He2+ impact are calculated employing two different representations of the initial bound molecular wave function. The variation of the total cross sections due to this change in the description of the initial wave function and due to changes of the distortion factors in the entrance and exit channels is studied.

Despite the large amount of research attracted by the above phenomenology since long ago, quite a few realistic model simulations are available. Many lattice dynamical calculations have been performed for each isolated material, but the only unified view of their ferroelectric behavior has been provided by the nonlinear oxygen polarizability model. Although initially based on phonon data for the cubic phase, recent ab initio calculations confirm that the model is basically correct with regards to the energetics involved in the various ferroelectric distortions in KNbO3. Our molecular dynamics simulations show the crossover from a soft mode to an order-disorder dynamics in the cubic phase of KNbO3, the appearance of its various ferroelectric phases, and the soft-mode behavior of KTaO3.

With the purpose of including gravity in such a model, we present here a chart that simplifies the calculation of isostatic corrections for the thermal hypothesis (Pratt system). This chart was constructed from the 3-D gravity effect on a spherical earth of a thermal lithospheric "root" 400 km wide, extending between nearly 70 and 140 km depth, and whose flanks conform to the Nazca Plate subduction angle. The density contrast was assumed to be +30 kg/m3. The largest isostatic-thermal correction exceeds +59 mGal (about 1/7 of the maximum Bouguer anomaly in the area), and a corrected Bouguer anomaly can be obtained by adding chart corrections to the observed values. Thus, via gravity inversion of this anomaly, a better determination of the real crustal root and the isostatic condition at the bottom of the lithosphere is possible. The observed Bouguer anomaly reaches about -400 mGal in the Central Andes. Of this maximum value, -60 mGal may be justified by means of expansive thermal effects taking place in the lower half of the lithoshpere. The remaining -340 mGal correspond to a crustal root of 25 km due to orogenic shortening. Thus, the two classical hypotheses (Airy in the crust and Pratt in the lithosphere) are combined to explain the isostatic balance in this Andean sector. This gravity model is consistent with the seismic crustal results in an Andean section at latitude 24.5° south. © 1997 Osservatorio Geofisico Sperimentale.},

abstract={We compute the Gaussian-fluctuation corrections to the saddle-point Schwinger-boson results using collective coordinate methods. Concrete application to investigate the frustrated J1-J2 antiferromagnet on the square lattice shows that, unlike the saddle-point predictions, there is a quantum nonmagnetic phase for 0.53 ≲ J2/J1 ≲ 0.64. This result is obtained by considering the corrections to the spin stiffness on large lattices and extrapolating to the thermodynamic limit, which avoids the infinite-lattice infrared divergencies associated with Bose condensation. The very good agreement of our results with exact numerical values on finite clusters lends support to the calculational scheme employed.},

Variational calculations suggest that the resonating-valence-bond character of the spin correlations at short distances is responsible for the enhancement. Numerical results for uniform spin chains, with and without frustration, dimerized chains, ladders, and two dimensional clusters are in agreement with our conjecture. This short distance phenomenon occurs independently of the long distance behavior of the spin correlations in the undoped system.

So, the original Bouguer Chart - that was constrained to the exact area of the basin- was considerably extended using new g measured data. Residual anomalies obtained by four different 3D filtering methods have allowed us to find the minimum gravity area associated with the maximum sedimentaary thickness in a consistent way. Residual charts show morphological agreement among them and the same location of the minimum. However, this minimum is displaced northwestwards to the previous interpretation. This shows the advantages of using 3D better that 2D filtering. Besides, this makes clear that areas like this surrounded by structures with notorious gravity effects cannot be properly interpreted without involving them.},

Several relations among features of the solitons and magnetic properties of the system have been determined and compared with analytical predictions. We have studied in particular the relation between the soliton width and the spin-Peierls gap. Although this relation has the form predicted by bosonized field theories, we have found some important quantitative differences which could be relevant to describe experimental studies of spin-Peierls materials.},

abstract={The behavior of the electric-field gradients (EFG's) at all nuclear sites for YBa2Cu4O8 (Y124) under pressure has been obtained within the local-density approximation (LDA) to density-functional theory, using the full-potential linear-augmented plane-wave method. We have also calculated their changes with temperature by including solely effects due to the crystallographic temperature modifications. The need for using an extended basis to deal with errors due to extended core states or linearization of narrow states is demonstrated by comparing our results to those obtained using the more standard two-panel scheme. The calculated EFG's at ambient pressure for plane and chain Cu and O sites agree with already published theoretical values, but those of Y and Ba are quite different. The EFG's for which there exist experimental determinations are reproduced except for planar Cu, where a factor of three discrepancy is found. This is similar to the case of YBa2Cu3O6.9, where the EFG's of the planar Cu were off by a factor of two. The smaller predicted anisotropy has been attributed to a real failure of the LDA. As pressure is increased the calculated EFG's at planar Cu sites remain practically constant. Since many properties of Y124, including Tc, are very sensitive to pressure it has been speculated that there should be a corresponding charge redistribution in the Cu-O planes and this, in principle, should be reflected in changes in the components of the EFG's. This does not happen. Experimentally pressure changes in EFG's at Cu site are small. From our analysis of the p and d contributions to the EFG at planar Cu sites it is found that charge redistribution does indeed occur but in such a manner that the contribution to changes to the EFG cancels.},

abstract={An electronic speckle pattern interferometry system based on a frequency-doubled twin Nd:YAG laser emitting dual pulses at a TV camera field rate (50 Hz) was developed to analyse addition fringes generated by transient deformation of a test object. The main advance has been the automatic, quantitative analysis of dual-pulsed addition ESPI data by the introduction of carrier fringes and the application of Fourier methods. The carrier fringes are introduced between dual pulses by tilting the reference beam with a mirror driven by a galvanometer. The resulting deformation-modulated addition fringes are enhanced with a variance filter before evaluation of the phase distribution using a Fourier transform method with bandpass filtering. From the wrapped phase distribution, a continuous phase map is reconstructed using an iterative weighted least-squares unwrapper. The linear phase distribution associated with the carrier fringes is removed by evaluating it with a least-squares fitting algorithm. Preliminary results obtained for a thin plate submitted to an acoustic shock show the suitability of the system for the quantitative evaluation of transient deformation fields.

abstract={Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and maximum-entropy techniques are used to study the spectral function A(p,ω) of the one-band Hubbard model with strong coupling including a next-nearest-neighbor electronic hopping with amplitude t′/t= -0.35. These values of parameters are chosen to improve the comparison of the Hubbard model with angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) data for Sr2CuO2Cl2. A narrow quasiparticle (qp) band is observed in the QMC analysis at the temperature of the simulation T= t/3, both at and away from half-filling. Such a narrow band produces a large accumulation of weight in the density of states at the top of the valence band. As the electronic density &lt;n&gt; decreases further away from half-filling, the chemical potential travels through this energy window with a large number of states, and by &lt;n&gt;∼0.70 it has crossed it entirely. The region near momentum (0,π) and (π,0) in the spectral function is more sensitive to doping than momenta along the diagonal from (0,0) to (π,π). The evolution with hole density of the quasiparticle dispersion contains some of the features observed in recent ARPES data in the underdoped regime. For sufficiently large hole densities the "flat" bands at (π,0) cross the Fermi energy, a prediction that could be tested with ARPES techniques applied to overdoped cuprates. The population of the qp band introduces a hidden density in the system which produces interesting consequences when the quasiparticles are assumed to interact through antiferromagnetic fluctuations and studied with the BCS gap-equation formalism. In particular, a region of extended s-wave character is found to compete with the d wave in the overdoped regime, i.e., when the chemical potential has almost entirely crossed the qp band as &lt;n&gt; is reduced. The present study also shows that previous "real-space" pairing theories for the cuprates, such as the antiferromagnetic Van Hove scenario, originally constructed based on information gathered at half-filling, do not change their predictions if hole dispersions resembling noninteracting electrons with renormalized parameters are used.},

abstract={Low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests were conducted in Zircaloy-4 with a total strain range of ±0.5% in the temperature range 573-873 K where dynamic strain aging (DSA) manifestations in uniaxial tensile tests were reported. A time dependent linear cyclic hardening stage is the principal feature observed in this alloy. The cyclic hardening rate exhibits a peak in this temperature range. In order to evaluate the strain rate effects on the cyclic hardening, tests at strain rates 2 × 10-3 s-1 and 2 × 10-4 s-1 were performed. The location of the cyclic hardening rate peak depends on the strain rate suggesting the operation of a thermally activated mechanism. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations show that the linear hardening stage is characterized by a two-dimensional wall structure that evolves from the activation of two slip systems. DSA takes place during strain-controlled fatigue deformation at the same temperature range of that occurring during tensile deformation. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.},

abstract={The behaviour of the electric field gradients (EFGs) at all nuclear sites for YBa2Cu4O8 (Y124) under pressure have been obtained within the Local Density Approximation (LDA) to density functional (DFT), using the FP-LAPW method. The need for using an extended basis to deal with errors due to extended core states or linearization of narrow states is demonstrated by comparing our results to those obtained using the more standard two panel scheme. The calculated EFGs at ambient pressure for plane and chain Cu and O sites agree with already published theoretical values, but those of Y and Ba are quite different. The EFG's for which there exist experimental determinations are reproduced except for plane-Cu, where a factor 3 discrepancy is found. This is similar to the case of Y123, where the EFG's of the plane-Cu were off by a factor of 2. The smaller predicted anisotropy has been attributed to a real failure of LDA. As pressure is increased the calculated EFGs at plane-sites remain practically constant. Since many properties of Y124, including Tc, are very sensitive to pressure we propose that experimental evaluation of the EFGs under pressure could be used to give insight to charge redistributions in the CuO2 planes and to examine further the validity of predictions based of LDA calculations for H-Tc materials(HTSC).},

abstract={The optical emission from a dense magnetized plasma column (the Z pinch) was studied in experiments with a 1 kJ plasma focus using an optical multichannel analyser (OMA III). The plasma column (about 10 mm length and about 1 mm diameter) generated at the end of the co-axial discharge had a density of about 1019 cm-3, a duration of about 200 ns and a maximum circulating current of about 170 kA. All the most intense lines from the carrier gases (neutral atoms and ions) were found in the spectra in the optical range 340-700 nm, showing that the line intensity was independent of the pinch intensity. Also, an intense emission from other elements such as copper (belonging to the brass electrodes) and silicon (from the glass insulator) was observed with a strong dependence of their line emission intensities on the pinch intensity. By partially covering the electrode surfaces with aluminium sheets, and studying variation of the aluminium and copper line emission intensities with the pinch intensity, it was shown that the source of contamination could be attributed in part to the power energy density deposition of the current sheath during the breakdown and run down stages of the discharge, before the formation of the dense plasma column. This more energetic electrode (and glass insulator) erosion can be associated with a thinner current sheath, a condition that is also conducive to more efficient pinch formation. The possibility of covering the last centimetre of the electrode surfaces with materials with higher evaporation points offers an opportunity to reduce the contamination effect when the plasma focus is used as a surface-treatment apparatus.},

We found that the Mott transition at half filling is well described by the charge stiffness behavior, and that the values for this quantity off half filling agree reasonably well with numerical results.

The phenomenon of plastic localization in the vicinities of the inclusions is carefully described for different reinforcement volume fractions and thermo-mechanical loading. Equivalent stress, hydrostatic pressure and elastic and plastic strains are depicted as contour levels around a representative inclusion. Effective coefficients of thermal expansion of composites are calculated both under purely elastic composite response and at the onset of plastic localized deformation. The influence of plastic strain over those effective coefficients is shown to be detectable. The simulated stress-strain curves show the influence of interaction stresses over macroscopic yield stress by isolating this phenomenon from matrix hardening. Accumulated elastic energies and plastic work are calculated to show the different nature of purely thermal and mechanical loads. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.},

abstract={Literature addressing the existence of "hole pockets" in experiments for the high-Tc cuprates and in theoretical analysis of electronic models of correlated electrons is reviewed. It is argued that the issue is not conclusively resolved, both in theory and experiments. The apparently large Fermi surface observed in numerical studies of the doped Hubbard and t-J models suggests the presence of 1 - x carriers (with x the concentration of holes). However, this is in contradiction with results obtained in similar calculations for the Drude weight which scales with x at low doping. To address such a paradox, dressed operators are here used. Their spectral decomposition A (k,ω) is analyzed specially using the t-J model on ladders, but considering also chains and two-dimensional (2D) clusters. The results are contrasted against those obtained with the standard bare operators. It is concluded that substantial changes in the spectral weight can occur by replacing the bare hole creation operator by its dressed version. Apparently large Fermi surfaces can turn into small ones by working with quasiparticle (qp) operators that represent accurately the state of one hole. Thus, large Fermi surfaces in angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES), obtained by the sudden removal of an electron, may not be in contradiction with a visualization of the normal state of lightly doped antiferromagnets as composed of a gas of spin polarons with energies approximately obtained from the rigid band doping of the half-filled dispersion. The coexistence of a large Fermi surface in ARPES with, e.g., a holelike Hall coefficient seems possible in systems with strong correlations. In this paper the expression "hole pocket" is used as representing a large accumulation of spectral weight centered at k=(±π/2,±π/2) generated by antiferromagnetic correlations in 2D clusters, or in analogous positions for ladders and chains. The subtle issue of whether such hole pockets represent a true small Fermi surface or just large incoherent weight cannot be addressed with finite resolution techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission and numerical studies of electronic models. They only provide information about the location of the dominant weight in A(k,ω). The ideas discussed here are very general and they can be applied to a variety of problems where quasiparticles are strongly dressed by low energy excitations of the medium in which they are immersed.},

We show that off-center displacements of the W ion in WO3 are driven by the onset of covalent interactions with the nearest oxygen, while the metallic materials ReO3 and NaWO3 are stable when cubic. In the latter case, antibonding contributions due to the occupation of the conduction band oppose the deformation. The different behavior is justified by examining the band structure of the compounds. The effect of the different number of valence electrons and of the different nature of the transition metal on the electronic distribution in the solid are analyzed. Finally, by comparing the mechanical properties of the three oxides, we show that the antibonding conduction electron makes ReO3 very rigid and can suggest an explanation for the pressure-induced phase transition observed for this material.},

abstract={Pulsed ion beam implantation with plasma focus has proved to be an effective method of metal surface treatment for tribological purposes. Nevertheless, the pulsed nature and the continuous energy spectrum of the ion beams differ from those of the standard ion implantation processes. In this paper a model of the thermal evolution of the surface layers of stainless steel, titanium and copper, during and after nitrogen and argon ion beam incidence, is presented using the finite-difference method. In the calculations, the geometry and physical characteristics of the ion beams, the single-ion-solid interaction process and the thermal properties of the materials were used. The results showed a strong thermal effect consisting in the generation of transitory heating slopes and heating speeds as high as ∼3600 K μm-1 and ∼40 K ns-1 respectively, with maximum temperatures that can reach even the material evaporation point at the surface layers. The cooling down process, through the thermal conduction mechanism at the target bulk, turns out to be fast enough to produce the complete thermal relaxation of the target in only a few microseconds after the end of the ion beam incidence. The results presented are contrasted with experiments performed in similar conditions to those used in the numerical model.},

abstract={We analyse the validity ranges of the adiabatic and anti-adiabatic approximations for a model with electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions for a three-site cluster. This model describes the motion of apical oxygen atoms in YBa2Cu3O7. We show that the adiabatic approximation still applies for critical infrared coupling where the gap between the ground state and first excited electronic state becomes nearly equal to the double-well potential barrier. For this high coupling value, the motion of holes and ions is already highly correlated. We arrive at the non trivial conclusion that in this model the adiabatic approximation is valid even in a parameter region where the electronic energy scale is not much larger than the phononic energy scale. This approximation is able to describe polaronic effects which have been shown to appear in the infrared absorption spectrum in previous exact numerical calculations. We also investigate the range of validity of the anti-adiabatic approximation. We find that the window where none of the above-mentioned approximations is valid shrinks with decreasing on-site repulsion U until it closes at U = 0 in agreement with other work in the literature.},

Energy changes associated with small deformations from the cubic phase indicate that ReO3 and the tungsten bronze are stable when cubic while the W ion in WO3 shows a tendency to off-center displacements. The different behavior is explained by examining the band structure of the compounds. Calculated frequencies and eigen-vectors of Γ phonons in ReO3 corroborate the existence of high-frequency modes in this crystal which supports a recent theoretical proposal for the interpretation of its electrical resistivity.},

We find good agrement with experimental melting temperature for lead (Pb) and a reasonable prediction for noble and transition metals. This was done by changing only an overall energy scale. The local structure of the metal below the melting point is distorted with respect to the perfect solid-phase structure. We associate the distortion with the appearance of defects in the crystalline phase which act as the precursor of the melting. The liquid has a considerable structure above the melting temperature which resembles the local structure of the solid. At higher temperatures where diffusional dynamics is activated the liquid loses its local structure. Our results suggest that the elastic instability alone cannot be responsible for the melting.},

abstract={The influence of nonmagnetic impurities on the spectrum and dynamical spin structure factor of a model for CuGeO3 is studied. A simple extension to Zn-doped Sr Cu2 O3 is also discussed. Using exact diagonalization techniques and intuitive arguments we show that Zn doping introduces states in the spin-Peierls gap of CuGeO3. This effect can be understood easily in the large dimerization limit where doping by Zn creates "loose" S= 1/2 spins, which interact with each other through very weak effective antiferromagnetic couplings. When the dimerization is small, a similar effect is observed but now with the free S= 1/2 spins being the resulting S=1/2 ground state of severed chains with an odd number of sites. Experimental consequences of these results are discussed. It is interesting to observe that the spin correlations along the chains are enhanced by Zn doping according to the numerical data presented here. As recent numerical calculations have shown, similar arguments apply to ladders with nonmagnetic impurities simply replacing the tendency to dimerization in CuGeO3 by the tendency to form spin singlets along the rungs in SrCu2O3.},

abstract={The present study examines the cyclic deformation characteristics of Zircaloy-4. It had been found that the ciclic behavior of this material strongly depends on temperature. This work is primarily concerned with the intermediate temperatures range between 623 and 873 K characterized by an abnormal cyclic behavior which can be divided in three regions: a first stage with a high but decreasing hardening rate, a second stage where the peak tensile stress, 5, varies linearly with the number of cycles and a third stage which represents a period of decreasing rate of hardening where the stress goes through a maximum and then falls continuously as a consequence of specimen failure. Plotting the yield stress, the average strain hardening rate and the average cyclic hardening rate against temperature, it can be observed that both, the yield stress and the average strain hardening rate, show a plateau between 673 and 823 K while the average cyclic hardening rate shows a sharp peak in the same temperature range. The dislocation arrangement in specimens showing the higher linear cyclic hardening rate is characterized by two-dimensional wall structures which formation can be rationalized by an increase of dislocations due to stronger dislocation-solute atoms interactions.},

The current paper is devoted to the study of the first elastoplastic transition by continuum mechanics when the material is cooled from the fabrication temperature. An iterative generalized Eshelby model is used to calculate the elastoplastic solution. The matrix plastic yielding is localized in the reinforcement vicinities where an increase in dislocation density is considered. The plastic work due to CTE mismatch and cooling give some hints about dislocation density increment and consequent strengthening.

It is expected that big inclusions will act as internal constraints to be treated as much as boundary conditions. In the current investigation a regular distribution of W wires (.38 mm in diameter) were used as reinforcement of Cu single, bi- and tri-crystal matrices. The resultant composite was deformed by channel die perpendicularly to the wires axes in two steps. The original orientation and after deformation resultant textures were measured by using x-ray texture measurement techniques.

abstract={We present a Schwinger-boson approach to the Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We write the anisotropic interactions in terms of Schwinger bosons keeping the correct symmetries present in the spin representation, which allows us to perform a conserving mean-field approximation. Unlike previous studies of this model by linear spin-wave theory, our approach takes into account magnon-magnon interactions and includes the effects of three-boson terms characteristic of noncollinear phases. The results reproduce the linear spin-wave predictions in the semiclassical large-S limit, and show a small renormalization in the strong quantum limit S=1/2. For the sake of definiteness, we specialize the calculations for the pattern of Moriya vectors corresponding to the orthorhombic phase in La2CuO4, and give a fairly detailed account of the behavior of ground-state energy, anisotropy gap, and net ferromagnetic moment. In the last part of this work we generalize our approach to describe the geometry of the intermediate phase in La2-xNdxCuO4, and discuss the effects of including nondegenerate 2pz oxygen orbitals in the calculations.},

Fermion and boson fields are treated on an equal footing in a functional integral formulation. We show that, while in two and three dimensions there is a metal-insulator transition as the interaction U increases, in one dimension our approach always gives an insulating state. Short-range spin-spin correlations are included at the saddle-point level for all values of U, giving a good description of the insulating state. We show that the energy gap in the one-particle spectrum increases from zero as (U-U c) α, where U c. is the critical value of the on-site interaction and the exponent α is 1 and 1/2 for 2 and 3 dimensions, respectively.},

abstract={The electronic structure of the high-Tc superconductor YBa2Cu4O8 and its change under pressure have been determined within the local density approximation (LDA) to density functional (DF) theory using the full-potential Linearized Muffin Tin Orbital (LMTO) method. The pressure dependence of the energy positions of the plane-derived and chain-derived bands which lie close to and cross the Fermi energy indicates the existence of a hole transfer from the CuO chains and ionic elements to the CuO2 planes with a rate that diminishes as pressure increases. The behaviour of the frequencies of the Cu(2) and apical-oxygen modes under pressure which have recently been described in Raman measurements are studied in the framework of the Frozen Phonon Approximation. The agreement with experiment shows that the intricate mechanisms involved as pressure varies (charge transfer and changes to the lattice dynamical properties) can be well described by state of the art electronic structure calculations which treat the many-body Coulomb interactions within the LDA.},

abstract={How do learning processes escape from local optima? Doing so requires an exploration of the landscape at a range of the order of the landscape correlation length - a "long jump" in synapsis space. This brings up a dilemma: because of the high dimensionality of this space, the probability that a random long jump lead to a better optimum is nearly zero. We conjecture that "intelligent" coarse-grained learning operators emerge as a consequence of a self-organization process in neural systems, as follows. The presentation of a single new data vector stimulates the recall of other vectors, each of which generates a small displacement in synapsis space. The sum of these displacements constitutes a coarse-grained learning event. Although long jumps are occasionally needed to escape from local optima, they should be the exception rather than the rule. This leads us to propose a neural network model where the recall process self-organizes to a critical state and one has a power-law distribution in the number of data vectors recalled.},

abstract={A formalism is developed for evaluating probabilities and cross sections for multiple-electron transitions in scattering of molecules and clusters by charged collision partners. First, the molecule is divided into subclusters each made up of identical centers (atoms). Within each subcluster coherent scattering from identical centers may lead to observable phase terms and a geometrical structure factor. Then, using a mean field approximation to describe the interactions between centers we obtain AI∼ΣkΠke iδkIAIk. Second, the independent electron approximation for each center may be obtained by neglecting the correlation between electrons in each center. The probability amplitude for each center is then a product of single electron transition probability amplitudes, aIk i, i.e. AIk ≈Πiaik i.. Finally, the independent subcluster approximation is introduced by neglecting the interactions between different subclusters in the molecule or cluster. The total probability amplitude then reduces to a simple product of amplitudes for each subcluster, A ≈ III/AI. Limitations of this simple approximation are discussed. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={Cu-Li alloys obtained by electrodeposition were studied by means of the mechanical dynamical spectroscopy (MDS) technique (also called mechanical spectroscopy), which consists of the simultaneous measurement of the damping and the elastic modulus as a function of temperature. In this work the MDS measurements were performed as a function of temperature. Also the strain amplitude dependent damping behaviour was studied. The damping spectrum of pure copper as a function of temperature shows low and the intermediate temperature grain boundary damping peaks at approximately 500 and 750 K respectively. It should be pointed out that, in the Cu-Li alloys a new peak at 625 K was found. This new peak could be the result of two physical effects, which are overlapped. The first effect would be a peak owing to the melting of the Cu 18 at.% Li crystals and the second effect would be a peak owing to the Zener's pair reorientation mechanism. The influence of the thermomechanical state of the samples before being electrodeposited was investigated, and the changes in the MDS spectra, measured during heating and cooling were also investigated.},

Its form is motivated by the phenomenology of the underdoped high-tC cuprates, as discussed in previous literature.

Numerical techniques show that the model has strong pairing correlations in the ground state at low fermionic density. Within a selfconsistent random phase approximation diagrammatic study, the model has a d-wave superconducting (SC) phase. The density dependence of the critical temperature is calculated. We argue that in the context of d-wave SC this model fulfills the role that the attractive on-site Hubbard model has played for s-wave SC. We also show that another candidate, the attractive t-U-V model, is actually not useful as a toy model for d-wave SC for a variety of reasons.},

abstract={The sintering of Al2O3/SiC ceramic composite leads to a state of high internal stresses in the composite material at room temperature because of the difference in thermal contraction between matrix and particles. It has been shown in a previous work1 that the interaction among fibers must be accounted for in order to predict correctly the residual stresses. In the present paper we develop a numerical scheme that permits taking into account such interaction for an arbitrary distribution of fiber directions (DFD) and for completely anisotropic properties of the phases. We apply the formulation to calculate the average strain in the matrix (due to the interaction among fibers) and the effective thermal coefficients of the composite. We find that the average strain in the matrix depends strongly on the DFD and that the predictions agree with measurements done by Majumdar and Kupperman.3 We prove that the effective thermal coefficients of the composite are not sensitive to the DFD when the matrix and the fibers exhibit isotropic thermal and elastic properties. Finally, we analyze the effect of the DFD and of the fiber interaction on the internal stresses inside the SiC fibers and compare with experimental values.},

abstract={Laser backscattering is an excellent tool to investigate size and concentration of suspended particles. It was successfully applied to the analysis of erythrocyte aggregation. A method is proposed that applies laser backscattering to the evaluation of the strength of the immunologic erythrocyte agglutination by approaching the energy required for the mechanical dissociation of agglutinates. Mills and Snabre have proposed a theory of laser backscattering for erythrocyte aggregation analysis. It is applied here to analyze the dissociation process of erythrocyte agglutinates performed by imposing a constant shear rate to the agglutinate suspension in a couette viscometer until a dispersion of isolated red cells is attained. Experimental verifications of the method were performed on the erythrocytes of the ABO group reacting against an anti-A test serum in twofold series dilutions. Spent energy is approached by a numerical process carried out on the backscattered intensity data registered during mechanical dissociation. Velocities of agglutination and dissociation lead to the calculation of dissociation parameters. These values are used to evaluate the strength of the immunological reaction and to discriminate weak subgroups of ABO system.},

abstract={The effects of nitrogen irradiation employing a plasma focus device on high purity polycrystalline copper are shown. It should be pointed out, that the effects of implantation process depend strongly of the previous thermal state of the sample. In fact, a new damping peak at approximately 750 K appears in irradiated samples which were previously annealed during 1 hour at 1073 K, but neither new peak at 750 K was measured in samples previously annealed during 5 and 15 hours. However other new peak appears at 1000 K. Moreover in the first case non hysteresis effects between a run up and down in temperature were found in both damping and modulus, but in the second one strong hysteresis effects appeared.},

abstract={In dual-plate speckle photography, the images corresponding to both deformation states are recorded on separate photographic plates. In this way, two major limitations of speckle photography, large rigid body displacements of the specimen and the 180-deg displacement direction ambiguity, can be overcome. When both photographic plates are placed with the glass base of one of them between the emulsions and they are illuminated by a narrow laser beam, a pattern of circular fringes is generated. Displacements can be measured by evaluating the distance between the center of the fringe pattern and the undiffracted laser beam. A new algorithm for the fully automatic analysis of such fringe patterns is presented. Its performance is tested using computer-simulated fringes and compared with performance obtained using a previously developed algorithm.},

abstract={Recently, a novel wavelet method to reduce speckle noise in synthetic aperture radar images was presented. The method, based on the thresholding of the wavelet coefficients of the transformed image, is computationally efficient and maintains sharp image features. The application of a similar method is explored to reduce speckle noise in TV holography fringes, which is a very important problem in the quantitative analysis of transient phenomena. Several thresholding approaches are used to test the noise reduction algorithm on computer-simulated fringes and results are assessed through the evaluation of two comparative parameters: the image fidelity and the speckle index. It is shown that the method achieves the highest speckle reduction when speckle grains have the same average size of the image pixels.},

We reconstruct the dynamics of computer-generated data corresponding to the logistic equation-which is known to have negligible autocorrelation-and the Lorenz map-which has significant autocorrelation-. Unlike previous claims in the literature, in both cases properly trained neural networks show better predictive skill than the autoregressive and simplex-like models. Finally, we discuss briefly applications of neural networks in the analysis of real-world time series. © 1995 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract={Ion implantation with plasma guns operated in the detonation mode presents several differences from normally used low current ion implanter systems. The most important differences are the high power of the beams generated with the plasma guns owing to their pulsed nature on one hand, and the plasma environment in which the target is immersed during the process of implantation on the other hand. Both effects were studied in this work. The temperature profiles and their evolutions during and after nitrogen implantation in pure titanium, stainless steel and copper were investigated by using the finite differences method. The calculation for nitrogen ion implantation (fluence of 1013 cm-2 and pulse time of 400 ns) in pure titanium, shows melting layers of 20 ns after the first 200 ns of implantation, with a fast cooling after the end of implantation. Thermal gradients of 1000 K μm-1 and a heating rate of 5 K ns-1 were also observed.

abstract={The infrared reflectivity (IR) of La2CuO4 is calculated by means of an anharmonic shell-model (SM) theory developed recently. The phonon frequencies and eigenvectors are taken from a SM fit of the experimental data in the principal symmetry directions. The phonon linewidths Γ are obtained first from the anharmonic terms of the potentials determined by fitting the phonon frequencies. The corresponding IR spectra show fairly good agreement with measurements, but this is remarkably improved by suitably varying the anharmonic terms. The frequency dependence of Γ explains certain shapes of the reflectivity bands, which led to erroneous assignments of phonons in a previous analysis of the spectra with ad hoc fitted Γ. The measurements show a low-frequency shoulder of the IR band corresponding to the stretching mode in the Cu-O2 plane ( 672 cm-1). We conclude that this feature cannot be interpreted as a peculiar shape of the band due to the frequency dependence of Γ, and should be ascribed to an additional IR-active, possibly polaronic excitation. © 1995 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Models of strongly correlated electrons that tend to phase separate are studied including a long-range 1/r repulsive interaction. It is observed that charge-density-wave states become stable as the strength of the 1/r term, Vcoul, is increased. Due to this effect, the domain of stability of the superconducting phases that appear near phase separation at Vcoul=0 is not enlarged by a 1/r interaction as naively expected. Nevertheless, superconductivity exists in a finite region of parameter space, even if phase separation is suppressed. Our results have implications for some theories of the cuprates. © 1995 The American Physical Society.},

Photometric readings performed on the elliptical diffraction pattern generated by the shear elongated cells and photometrically recorded curves of creep and recovery of cells, are used in the calculations of theological properties, averaged over several millions of cells. Results obtained from different hematological disorders are presented and compared with those obtained from healthy donors, showing significative differences that are in accordance with the type and the state of the corresponding disease. Computed values representative of the elastic modulus of normal cells agree very well with those ones determined with the micropipette technique (2) while retardation time, and consequently values of surface viscosity, obtained by the diffractometric technique are somewhat smaller than the ones obtained by the shape recovery in micropipettes.},

abstract={The plastic properties of anisotropic polycrystalline aggregates and polyphase materials are in general non-homogeneous and, as a consequence, so is the local plastic deformation. We present in this work a model that describes the plastic behaviour of non-homogeneous materials composed of anisotropic regions (grains or phases). Our model is based on describing each region as a viscoplastic inclusion embedded in the effective medium represented by the other grains, and incorporates explicitly the grain interaction with its surroundings and the plastic anisotropy of grain and matrix. Within the model the grain response is coupled to the overall response of the polycrystal and the grain deformation may differ from the polycrystal's. A characteristic of our approach is that those deformation systems with lower critical resolved shear stress tend to be more active, and less than five systems per grain are sufficient to accomodate the imposed overall deformation. In this work we explore the consequences and the limits of the model, and its dependence on the assumed rate sensitivity as well. We combine the self-consistent formulation with a volume fraction transfer scheme for treating the reorientation due to twinning, and simulate rolling textures of brass (f.c.c.), Zircaloy (h.c.p.), calcite (trigonal) and uranium (orthorhombic). We compare the results with experimental measurements and Taylor-type predictions, infer information concerning the microscopic deformation mechanisms and discuss the limits of applicability of the approach. © 1994.},

We apply an anharmonic perturbation theory which properly takes into account the adiabatic constraint for the shell's polarization.

The quasiparticle dispersion relations have the correct zero-mode structure, without the pathologies present in the standard spin-wave approximation.

The method consists in measuring the Snoek relaxation during isotherms at low frequencies in a subresonant forced pendulum. Chemical analysis by a vacuum fusion technique is necessary to check the proportionality factor between the height of the internal friction peak and the interstitial nitrogen content. It is assumed that the polycrystalline samples are not textured and that the nitrogen is completely dissolved by annealing in an inert atmosphere. This kind of evaluation could be useful for characterizing b.c.c. metals in relation to certain applications where mechanical properties could be altered by the free nitrogen content. © 1994.},

We implement for that purpose an elasto-plastic self-consistent scheme that accounts for grain interactions, and compare our predictions with experimental determinations of residual strains obtained by neutron diffraction. Our results are in good quantitative agreement with the experimental evidence, and represent a qualitative improvement over the predictions of the more rigid upper-bound approach. We discuss the role that slip and twinning systems play in the macroscopic response of the aggregate and in the evolution of internal stresses. © 1994.},

Besides a softening and broadening of the breathing phonon peak with decreasing temperature, a quasistatic peak appears at short wavelengths. This occurs approximately below a temperature at which the breathing phonon becomes broadest and the softening reverses. An additional finite-frequency nonphononic structure appears at low temperature. We interpret these results in terms of nonlinear excitations of the model. © 1993 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Molecular-alignment effects in the transfer excitation of H2 by high-velocity heavy ions are studied using a two-step mechanism with amplitudes evaluated from first-order perturbation theory. Two-electron transfer excitation is treated as a result of two independent collision processes (excitation and electron transfer). Cross sections for each one-electron subprocess as well as the combined two-electron process are calculated as functions of the molecular-alignment angle. Within the independent-electron approximation, the dynamic roles of electron excitation and transfer in conjunction with molecular alignment are explored. While both excitation and transfer cross sections may strongly depend on molecular alignment, it is electron transfer that is largely responsible for the molecular-alignment dependence in the transfer excitation process. Interpretation of some experimental observations based on this model will also be discussed. © 1993 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={The internal friction (loss tangent) of solids is normally measured, as a function of temperature, with a torsion pendulum operating in free decay. Curves of the internal friction and the oscillation frequency, against temperature, are obtained at various moments of inertia, to extract the parameters characteristic of the relaxation process (relaxation time and strength). In all these experiments only the temperature is considered as an independent variable and the moment of inertia of the pendulum is mainly used to shift the internal friction peaks in the temperature scale. It is pointed out in the paper that the moment of inertia is also an independent variable which can be used to determine, with high accuracy, if the measured peak is of the Debye type or not. A new torsion pendulum, with continuously variable moment of inertia is presented, which allows measurements of the partial derivative of the internal friction and the oscillation frequency with respect to the moment of inertia, at constant temperature. Finally, some measurements of the Snoek relaxation in Nb-O alloys are presented, to show the applicability of the concepts developed in the paper. © 1992 Società Italiana di Fisica.},

The effects of thermal stress cycling on the cyclic hardening and/or softening behavior and the accompanying microstructural changes in the specimen were evaluated. A cyclic hardening is observed for all temperature changes. This hardening is followed by a continous softening that occupies the major part of total fatigue life. Only for the temperature amplitude of 473-823 K an extended saturation plateau was observed. The dislocation structure formed after failure depends on the temperature amplitude. These structures will evolve from a veins and walls structure for the lowest temperature amplitude to a completely equiaxed cell structure for the highest temperature amplitude. © 1992.},

abstract={In many polycrystals of less than cubic crystal symmetry, plastic deformation is dominated by twinning. In particular, we will treat the case of Zr and Zr alloys in detail. We propose a new method for modelling grain reorientation due to twinning, which is based on a Volume Fraction Transfer (VFT) scheme; the scheme is also applied to the slip modes. We find that this method predicts textures that are, when twinning is the dominant mode, considerably different from and in better agreement with experiment than the conventional schemes which reorient an entire grain when some criterion has been met. Various combinations of slip and twinning modes and of the associated critical stresses are systematically investigated for the case of rolling, tension and compression of Zr alloys. A comparison of various predicted and experimental textures leads to the conclusion that twinning must, indeed, be controlling texture development. © 1991.},

abstract={Using exact diagonalization we compute the binding energy of two holes for the t-J model in lattices with different boundary conditions. We find that with periodic, antiperiodic, mixed, and other boundary conditions there is always negative binding energy in a certain range of J, for all the sizes studied. This is different from the behavior obtained in the one-dimensional case, suggesting that binding might survive in the thermodynamic limit in two dimensions. © 1991 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={Data on Poisson's ratio as a function of temperature, obtained in rods and tubes of Zircaloy-4 through dynamical measurements in longitudinal excitations, are presented. The influence of texture and the contribution of a coupling between longitudinal and transversal vibrations on the observed temperature dependence of this elastic constant, is discussed. Finally, an anelastic effect produced by relaxation of Poisson's ratio, in the temperature region between 400 and 450 K, is also presented. This effect is present only in tubular specimens and it is discussed in terms of a theory of anelastic relaxation under multiaxial strains. © 1988 Chapman and Hall Ltd.},

abstract={We study the classical statistical mechanics of a shell-model chain with a quartic electron-ion interaction in one ionic species. In order to avoid long-range interactions generated by the adiabatic treatment of the shells, we assign them a finite mass. Under integration of the harmonic degrees of freedom, the partition function is shown to correspond to an effective 4 model. This allows us to apply the transfer-integral technique for calculation of the free energy in the displacive limit. For the continuum we obtain exact kinktype solutions of the equations of motion. These excitations, together with phonons which represent oscillations about kink configurations, are considered as interacting quasiparticles for the construction of the free energy, thus reobtaining the exact results in the low-temperature limit. This approach allows the extension of our results to the adiabatic case. © 1988 The American Physical Society.},

abstract={The effective constraint between a gravity field and its first derivative, measured over a discrete set of points, is discussed as for its contribution to the solution of inversion problems. Accuracy questions in gradient surveys are examined and since on the other hand gradient values are theoretically determined by a potential field on a surface, an equivalence is established between gravity and gradient inversions, and it is shown that no significant improvement can be introduced with the simultaneous inversion if measurement points are adequately close. In a numerical example, conclusions are confirmed by analyzing the generalized eigenvalues of the singular value decomposition. Because of the close analogy existing through the Poisson relation between magnetic and gravity gradient fields generated by the same homogeneous body, correlations between the preceding study and the simultaneous gravity and magnetic inversion are made in order to clarify the effective determination of the solutions. © 1988.},

The measurements have been performed in longitudinal excitation and several harmonics were used, to obtain Poisson's ratio from the measured resonant frequencies. The maximum observed in the temperature dependence of Young's modulus, for the fundamental resonant frequency, is attributed to a stress-induced disordering of carbon atoms in the octahedral interstices of the martensitic matrix. The increases of Young's modulus with temperature are described in terms of expressions deduced in the paper, which are based on Landau theory of second-order phase transitions. The critical temperature is related to the Ms temperature which characterizes the martensitic phase transition. Finally, the temperature dependence of Poisson's ratio is described in terms of a theory of anelastic behaviour under multiaxial strains, based on the standard anelastic solid model. © 1987 Chapman and Hall Ltd.},

abstract={In order to verify the quality of the upwards-continuation method for defining regional anomalies, a theoretical hydrostatically compensated model was prepared. Its corresponding Bouguer anomaly was determined. It was then "contaminated" by introducing into the initial model small sub-surface structures with positive, negative, and combinations of both positive and negative density contrast. The Bouguer anomalies of the models so prepared were continued to different elevations and then inverted from there with different methods. The results show consistency in the model definition when rules for filter and data digitization and truncation are carefully observed. Hence, we propose the following procedure to define regional anomalies: 1 - To upwards-continue the field until short wave-length disappear. 2 - To invert from there the gravimetric response to obtain the model. 3 - To calculate the model direct response from the topographic level, which must conform a suitable regional anomaly when compared with the observed anomaly. The regional anomalies so obtained in the studied examples are in accordance with the theoretical ones.},

abstract={A comparison has been made between the new laser diffraction technique and the well known method of erythrocyte filterability for the determination of erythrocyte deformability. A hyperbolic correlation has been found between deformation index and filtration time. This correlation becomes linear by inversing the deformation index. Our results demonstrate that filterability (filtration time method) selects the more deformable cells from the whole population. In this way, statistic tests have demonstrated that filtered cells are more deformable than cells retained above the filter at 95% confidence level.},

We also demonstrate that this solution is unique for all the evolution of the universe with cosmological interest.

A laser beam traversing the sample layer at r distance from the center of disks, displays a diffraction pattern 'at infinity'. At no shear stress the cells have discoidal shapes and the diffraction pattern is circular. Shear-induced elongation of cells leads to an elliptical diffraction pattern, its geometric characteristics being directly related to those of deformed cells.

abstract={The accurate knowledge of the thermal performance of massive buildings is important in solar design. Considering vertical homogeneous walls, initial and boundary data can be fitted by low-order polynomials. Under these assumption for the driving functions, analytical solutions are given for the one-dimensional heat equation that gives the wall temperature. Stored energy is also obtained. The formulae can be programmed in microcomputers or, in certain cases, in hand-held computers, this possibility being useful for field analysis. Two sets of data obtained in a test module are compared with model predictions for a preliminary validation. © 1985.},

abstract={We derive the family of all Hadamard symmetric kernels for a quantum massive scalar field propagating at a classical curved background, which can be constructed in terms of purely local geometric quantities. No such kernal exists in the massless limit, unless "restricted geometric objects", which only have a meaning at conformally flat metrics, are used in its construction. We discuss the relation of this result with the anomalous trace of the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor in the case of conformal triviality. Trace anomaly is shown to be inevitable, if the renormalization recipe is defined in terms of purely geometric quantities, as a consequence of the inexistence of a geometric generalization encompassing every possible space-time of the well-known conformal-vacuum at Robertson-Walker universes. © 1984.},

Differential cross sections for excitation to the n=2 states of hydrogen by He+ impact, in the intermediate energy region, are calculated as an application of this model. A reasonable agreement with recent experimental data is obtained using a two-state atomic expansion. The negligible influence of the He(1s, 2p+or-1) capture state on the excitation processes has been determined.},
